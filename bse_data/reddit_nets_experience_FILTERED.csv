nba,[Barrasso] Charles Barkley: ‘I Root Against All Superteams’,"&gt;“KD is a great player, and I think he’s a great kid,” Barkley said on a conference call for this weekend’s American Century Championship golf tournament. “I don’t know him that well, but I’m not a fan of superteams. So listen, if they win it, they win it, but to be perfectly clear, I’m rooting against those guys. I root against all superteams.

&gt;“If I’d known you guys were going to make fun of me for not winning a championship, I would have joined a superteam back in my day—me and Patrick [Ewing] and Karl Malone and John Stockton. But I feel good about my legacy. I’m pretty sure Patrick and John and Karl do, too. LeBron [James] started this superteam thing [in Miami], and hey, it’s the way the game is played now.”

&gt;“When Kawhi [Leonard] left Toronto—other than Chicago, that’s my favorite city in the world, [but] I’m never going there again,” Barkley said, noting that the Raptors are no longer a contender since Leonard left in free agency. “When LeBron left Cleveland, I’m never going there again. When James [Harden] left Houston, I’m never going to Houston again. Same thing when LeBron left Miami. Oklahoma City, once KD left, we’re never going back there again. And I don’t think that’s good for the game.

&gt;“To go back to my day, even though we didn’t win the championship, the Sixers were worth watching. The Knicks were worth watching. The Pacers were worth watching when Reggie was there, same thing with Atlanta and Dominique. I just don’t think it’s good for business, but these young kids, they all fold to peer pressure and feel like they’ve got to win a championship or their life sucks. I don’t believe that. Listen, there’s not many people I’d trade my life with.”

&gt;“I hope the two sides [fans and players] come together. I think the fans realize that life sucks without sports. If you don’t have sports, all you have is reality, and reality sucks. And the players learned that sports really sucks without fans. I’m hoping this is a turning point where we start having more respect for each other, and my jackass players don’t load-manage and sit out when they’re not hurt and won’t play back-to-back games. And I hope the fans [realize], if they give 110%, whether we win or not, [you] live with that. I’m hoping this is a time of reflection for fans and players to realize we’re much better together than apart.”

&gt;“I’m glad to see the Suns doing well. The food is better now. When they weren’t winning, they were selling cold nachos. They weren’t even putting jalapenos on it. You could park right beside the court, there were no fans. Now we’re back to being sold out every night. I love it.”

nba,"[OC] if Damian Lillard leaves the team to chase rings, he may be giving up on another pursuit — being the greatest player in team history. What other players are in the running for theirs?","When we talk about accolades for NBA players, there are always a few key items on the checklist: All-Star trips, All-NBA berths, MVPs, etc. But one rules them all: *rings.* 

The mad quest for [gold](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Smaug) has led players on journeys all across the map. Are they trying to win out of a competitive spirit? To shut up critics and trolls? To earn glory that will last a lifetime? Obviously that has worked from time to time, but other times the effort feels a little empty -- even in success. Perhaps your team was TOO good (like Kevin Durant), or you weren't the MAIN star on the team, or your opponent got injured. 

It's also fair to say that winning a ring isn't all that unusual. If my math checks out, a team wins a title every year. That makes 75 years of NBA champions -- 65 years of MVP (which started in 1956) -- 53 years of Finals MVP (which started in 1969). It's an exclusive club -- especially when you consider repeats -- but it's a growing one.

In contrast, there's a prestigious club that will grow more slowly. A basketball honor that we don't discuss very often. That is: being the **greatest player in your franchise's history.** 

Perhaps the fact that we don't discuss that topic very often devalues the concept and contributes to a culture of team swapping and ring chasing. If we valued the Team GOAT as a badge of honor, perhaps players would stick around more often and build their legacy at home. 

Of course, there's no easy way to define a Team GOAT. There's subjectivity involved in terms of what criteria you use and what accolades you value the most. Then again, when has subjectivity ever stopped us from debating player rankings before?

Interested in that topic, I wanted to go through the league and review each team's GOAT, and debate whether a current player has a chance of grabbing that mantle. An important note of distinction here: we're not talking about the best player to ever weigh a team's uniform -- we're rankings these players contributions on THAT team and that team only, as if their other years didn't exist.

Rather than give specific percentage odds for each, we'll group them into a few tiers. Locks or **Near Locks** (defined as over an 80% chance), **Likely** (somewhere in between 50-80% chance), **Possible** (somewhere in between 25-50%), **Unlikely** (5-25%), and **Almost No Chance** (less than 5%).

---

######**TEAM GOAT DISCUSSIONS**

**ATLANTA.** For this exercise, we're going to lean heavily on total ""win shares"" with the team, which is conveniently listed on basketball-reference's team pages. Using that as our default ranking, two candidates emerge: Bob Pettit (136 win shares, mostly when the team was in St. Louis) and Dominque Wilkins (107 WS). Pettit may be harder to beat than young fans realize; he was an All-Star in each of his 11 seasons, and he won MVP twice. In fact, he cracked the top 5 in MVP voting on 8 separate occasions. Even more notably, he led the team to their only NBA championship. That's an incredible resume that's going to be tough for Trae Young to beat. Young can best Pettit in longevity and total points, but he's probably going to need to win multiple titles to get this more nuanced honor. We'll call this one **unlikely.** If the Hawks can reconfigure their roster and get back to contender status, then perhaps this ups back into ""possible.""

---

**BOSTON**. Like Trae Young, Jayson Tatum benefits from a ""one-and-done"" era where he can jump to the NBA and start putting up numbers immediately. He's in his 5th season right now and he's still only 23 years old. Averaging about 6.5-7 wins shares per year, he can potentially crack 100. That said, this isn't a franchise that's graded by win shares. They win *titles.* Whether you want to call their GOAT Bill Russell (164 WS, 11 titles, 5 MVPs) or Larry Bird (146 WS, 3 titles, 3 MVPs), there's **almost no chance** that Tatum rises to the top of this ladder.

---

**BROOKLYN**. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving surprised a lot of people when they chose to go to the Nets, a team without much of a storied history. Perhaps they were anticipating this post. After all, there's a wide open lane here. ""Dr. J"" Julius Erving led the Nets to two ABA titles, and Jason Kidd led the team to two NBA Finals, but neither stayed with the franchise long. Erving lasted 3 seasons, Kidd only 6.5. As a result, the team's leader in win shares is Buck Williams with 63. Going forward, the question will be: how long can Kevin Durant (age 33) last? How many titles can he rack up in the meantime? The longevity won't be on his side, but winning a couple of titles may be a realistic goal presuming this team can be healthy at the right time. Despite all the injury issues, they're still the Vegas favorite this season. Given that, Durant or James Harden may be **possible** Team GOATS. Then again, it's ""possible"" the team isn't healthy down the stretch and blows it up entirely this summer.

---

**CHARLOTTE**. Even if we include the old Charlotte Hornets' history here, this is another franchise with a relatively open lane to GOAT. In over 30+ years, they've never even reached the Conference Finals. Kemba Walker leads the way with 48.5 win shares, which is an attainable goal for young LaMelo Ball. Ball snagged 2.8 as a rookie, and is on pace to double that this season. If he can play 10 years with the franchise, he'll likely become their GOAT. Will he actually stay in Charlotte that long? It's TBD, so let's call this one **possible** as well.

---

**CHICAGO**. Super scorer Zach LaVine has proven a lot of skeptics wrong, but he'd need to clone himself a few times to come close to Michael Jordan (205 WS, 6 titles, 5 MVPS). Our scale only goes as low as almost **no chance**, and this certainly qualifies.

---

**CLEVELAND.** The Cavs are in a similar boat here. Young studs Darius Garland and Evan Mobley both have awesome futures, but there’s a difference between awesome and immortal. **Almost no chance** they can surpass the iconic achievements of LeBron James here.

---

**DALLAS**. LaMelo Ball is chasing Kemba Walker in Charlotte, but Luka Doncic has a much higher bar here in Dirk Nowitzki. Thanks in part to his incredible longevity and loyalty, Nowitzki racked up 206 win shares with the team in addition to an MVP and NBA title. The win shares will be tough. Luka's career high is 8.8, so even if he gets to 10 a year, he'll need to rattle off 15+ years of peak performance. Going for multiple MVPs or multiple championships may be the easier path here. Can Luka win more than 1 of each? I wouldn't say that it's likely, but it's definitely **possible.** Dallas doesn't look like a title contender yet, but there's plenty of time for the kid (still age 22.)

---

**DENVER**. The international takeover continues. At the moment, the franchise leaders in win shares are Dan Issel (95) and Alex English (84). However, there's a Serbian freight train behind them that's about to run them off the road. Jokic has racked up an incredible 71 win shares in his career despite being only 26. He had 15.5 last season alone. Even if you think advanced stats are too kind to the Joker, he can make up for it with his MVP trophy, which neither Issel nor English have. As long as Jokic plays a few more seasons, he's a **near lock** to grab the GOAT status here.

---

**DETROIT.** After a slow start, # 1 pick Cade Cunningham is heating up and looking the part of a future All-Star. He also takes pride in his leadership abilities and may be the type of player to stick around for 10+ years. In terms of *win shares*, that may put him in play over franchise leader Bill Laimbeer (98 WS). In terms of *legacy*, he still will be **unlikely** to pass Isiah Thomas, who racked up 2 titles and 11 All-Star appearances. That's nothing against Cunningham -- it's just friggin' hard to win multiple championships.

---

**GOLDEN STATE.** It's hard to win multiple championships -- it's hard to be a Team GOAT. But at the moment, we have one player who has already done it. Steph Curry has recently passed over Wilt Chamberlain in total win shares for the team -- 117 to 114 (Chamberlain didn't play his entire career with them). Add in the fact that Curry won 2 MVPs and 3 titles and his overall impact on the game, and he could retire tomorrow as the greatest Warrior of all time. He's our first official **lock.**

---

**HOUSTON**. Perhaps Damian Lillard should take note, because James Harden essentially waved the white flag on his quest for Team GOAT with his trade demand last year. If he had stuck around, perhaps Harden (115 WS) could have challenged Hakeem Olajuwon (160) for the top spot. That said, matching Olajuwon and winning two titles would have been much more difficult. Looking forward, is there any chance Jalen Green or Alperen Sengun could threaten Olajuwon? *Theoretically*, sure, but realistically let's call this **almost no chance.**

---

**INDIANA**. Although he never got over the hump, Reggie Miller (174 WS) has a comfortable stranglehold on his team's GOAT. It's looking less and less likely -- **almost no chance** -- that a current team star like Domatas Sabonis could challenge him. Sabonis has made 2 All-Stars in his 5 years with the team, but his 30 win shares are a loooong way away from Miller. And according to some rumors, Sabonis may not be here much longer.

---

**L.A. CLIPPERS**. We have an opening, table 12. The Clippers have existed for over 50 seasons in some form or another, but they never won a title. Their best player ever is probably Chris Paul (team high 78 WS), but he only played 6 seasons with the franchise. Current stars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George may have trouble matching that, but they have a decent shot to win a title if they both come back healthy next year. To Clippers fans, I'd presume that's more meaningful than CP3's good-but-not-great ""Lob City"" era. Let's call it **possible.**

---

**L.A. LAKERS**. LeBron James already won a title in L.A. and could potentially win more, but he has **almost no chance** to beat local legends like Kobe Bryant (team high 173 WS, 5 titles, 1 MVP) or Magic Johnson (156 WS, 5 titles, 3 MVPs.) Remember, we're only talking about their contributions on this particular team.

---

**MEMPHIS**. The Grizzlies don't have the type of history as the Lakers do, which puts this franchise in play. The best right now would probably be Marc Gasol (77 WS). But while Gasol had one DPOY, the rest of his resume is a little light for a Team GOAT -- he only made 3 All-Star teams and never finished higher than 8th in MVP voting. Given that, Ja Morant's ascension is certainly **possible.** Heck, he's on target to finish in the top 8 in MVP this season. If he stays healthy and sticks around Memphis for his whole career, he'll likely best Gasol in WS. Of course, the real key may be whether his squad can make a Finals appearance (the Grit n' Grind teams peaked in the Conference Finals.) 

---

**MIAMI**. Prime LeBron James was the best player in franchise history, but in terms of career accomplishments it'd have to be Dwyane Wade (116 WS, 3 titles.) Jimmy Butler arrived too late to challenge that, and Bam Adebayo doesn't have the type of game that's going to put him in MVP races. I'd suggest there's **almost no chance** either can challenge Wade here.

---

**MILWAUKEE**. So far, we've given one Team GOAT to Steph Curry, and presumed Nikola Jokic is on the verge of cracking that in Denver. The same applies here to Giannis Antetokounmpo, whom I'll call another **near lock.** I don't think he officially has it yet though. Although Kareem Abdul-Jabbar only played 6 years for the franchise, he holds a lead over Giannis in win shares 115 to 81. Giannis should be able to pass him in a couple of years though and end all debates about Team GOAT status (again, career value, not prime value.)

---

**MINNESOTA**. The Timberwolves have never won a title or even made the Finals in their 33-year history, but Kevin Garnett still feels like he's locked into the top spot as a beloved Team GOAT. He racked up 140 win shares, 10 All-Star trips, and 1 MVP by the time he left for Boston. In theory, Karl-Anthony Towns may be able to challenge the win shares if he sticks around (he's about halfway there at 61 right now), but I don't know if he has enough of a two-way game to supplant Garnett in the minds of fans. A title would do it, but that's more **unlikely** than realistic. 

---

**NEW ORLEANS**. If we count all versions dating back to 2002, then Chris Paul is going to grab his second Team GOAT here (as he leads the team with 76 win shares and came closest to winning MVP.) It's a beatable total, but can it be beaten by Zion Williamson or Brandon Ingram? If fully healthy, Williamson would have a great chance. He recorded 8.7 win shares in just 61 games last season. But can we expect Williamson to play 6-7 years at an elite level? And stay with this franchise for that whole time? That combo may be **unlikely** right now. Meanwhile, Ingram only has about 13 win shares in his 3 seasons, so I'm not sure he has enough upside to crack the top spot either.

---

**N.Y. KNICKS**. Right now, I'd give the nod to Patrick Ewing (team high 123 WS) despite the fact that he never won the title. Of the current crop, you'd presume a young player like R.J. Barrett may have the best chance if he improves and plays 10+ years with the team. Still, does he have it in him to beat Ewing and his 11 All-Star trips? It's between an ""unlikely"" and an **almost no chance** to me, so I'll lean to the latter.

---

**OKLAHOMA CITY**. If you include the Sonics history, then Gary Payton (124 WS) holds the lead over Kevin Durant (108 WS) and Russell Westbrook (97 WS). It's possible that young Shai Gilgeous-Alexander beats them in terms of longevity with the team, but there's **almost no chance** he can match their peak production and start winning MVPS. Keep grabbing those lottery balls, Sam Presti, because you may need another all-timer to get back to the Finals.

---

**ORLANDO**. Shaquille O'Neal only played 4 seasons with Orlando, so he trails Dwight Howard by a large margin in terms of win shares (88 to 48, respectively.) Younger fans may forget just how good Dwight Howard was in his day -- he cracked the top 5 in MVP voting in four separate seasons. I don't see any of the young Magic threatening that, so we'll give this one an **almost no chance** as well. 

---

**PHILADELPHIA**. Julius Erving is probably the most iconic 76er of all time, but if we base it on resume alone it may be hard to argue against Dolph Schayes. Back when the team was the Syracuse Nationals, Schayes led them to an NBA title and made 11 All-Star teams in the process. He also leads Erving in total win shares, 142 to 106. Current star Joel Embiid has a long way to go to reach that company. Given his durability problems, he's only reached 36 win shares -- a total that doesn't even crack the team's top 12 yet. He can probably make an argument if he wins multiple MVPs or multiple titles, but that's an **unlikely** combination. Of course, if Daryl Morey can pull in a haul for Ben Simmons at the deadline then we may have to rethink that. 

---

**PHOENIX**. Technically the team's leader in win shares is Shawn Marion with 93, but I'd say that either Steve Nash (83 WS) or Charles Barkley (44 WS) would be Team GOAT based on peak performance. I don't think there's much chance that Devin Booker is going to challenge for MVPs in the same way -- he's already in his 7th season and he's never cracked an All-NBA team yet. His advanced stats have never been great either, so he's only gotten up to 25.3 win shares so far. Still, it's **possible** that he can work his way into Team GOAT discussions in another way. The Suns haven't won a title in their 54-year history. If Booker can help make that happen -- and have a long, Reggie Miller-ish career -- then I think he'd be considered the franchise's GOAT.

---

**PORTLAND**. The inspiration for this post, Damian Lillard may have to sacrifice his chances to be Team GOAT if he never plays for the Trail Blazers again. In terms of *peak* performance, the best Blazer of all time is Bill Walton (who won the title and then MVP), but Walton only played 4 years for the franchise. In terms of career performance, Lillard is chasing Clyde Drexler. Drexler racked up 109 win shares (to Lillard's 95), 8 All-Star appearances (to Lillard's 6), and 2 Finals appearance (to Lillard's 0.) Where Lillard can make up for that deficit is longevity. Drexler left the team at age 32, while Lillard is still there (for now) at age 31. If he stays loyal and sticks around for 3-4 more years, he's **likely** to be considered their best ever.

---

**SACRAMENTO**. The ""Sacramento Kings"" don't have an illustrious history, but this franchise has been around the mill (first as the Rochester Royals, then Cincinnati Royals, then Kansas City Kings, then Sacramento Kings.) If we include all that history, there's **almost no chance** that De'Aaron Fox can surpass the individual greatness of Oscar Robertson (154 win shares.)

---

**SAN ANTONIO**. Ditto here. There are 5 San Antonio Spurs with 100+ win shares, led by Tim Duncan (206 WS) and David Robinson (179 WS.) When you factor in the titles to boot, then there's **almost no chance** that any of these young Spurs can reach those heights.

---

**TORONTO**. Kawhi Leonard was the face of the championship, but I suspect most Toronto fans would consider Kyle Lowry (75 win shares) their greatest player in whole. Lowry ""only"" played 9 years for the team, so it's possible that a young stud like Scottie Barnes can surpass that and surpass the win share total. Can he match Lowry's 6 All-Star trips and NBA title? That's somewhere between possible and **unlikely.** Barnes' all-around game doesn't lend itself to gaudy numbers and All-Star votes, but it's too hard to count out a rookie who's been this good.

---

**UTAH**. The Utah Jazz are good enough to contend for a title either this year or next. But even with that, I don't think anyone would consider Donovan Mitchell or Rudy Gobert on par with the freakish durability and longevity of Karl Malone (230 win shares) or John Stockton (208 WS). It'd probably take 2-3 titles for Gobert (third in franchise history with 82 WS) to take the mantle, and that falls into the **almost no chance** category.

---

**WASHINGTON**. Current star Bradley Beal has officially surpassed his old buddy John Wall on the win shares list (49 to 44), but he's still got some ways to go before he matches all-time leader Wes Unseld (110 WS.) Unseld also won an MVP and NBA trophy. The Beal Fan Club is formally petitioning for us to switch to ""total points"" though, because he's likely to catch franchise leader Elvin Hayes if he sticks around for next year (Hayes has 15,551, Beal 14,119.) Overall, it's hard to see the seeds of a title contending team here so we'll call this **unlikely.**

Clipper ships were mostly constructed in British and American shipyards, though France, Brazil, the Netherlands and other nations also produced some. Clippers sailed all over the world, primarily on the trade routes between the United Kingdom and its colonies in the east, in trans-Atlantic trade, and the New York-to-San Francisco route round Cape Horn during the California Gold Rush. Dutch clippers were built beginning in the 1850s for the tea trade and passenger service to Java. The boom years of the clipper ship era began in 1843 as a result of a growing demand for a more rapid delivery of tea from China. It continued under the stimulating influence of the discovery of gold in California and Australia in 1848 and 1851, and ended with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.

Heat fans all produce 1 person’s worth of heat so even if the world consisted of only Heat fans and some other guy who was a fan of the Knicks or whatever there would be more heat than Heat fans worth of heat. I am not a physics major though so don’t quote me on that

What actual jazz is:
We can have a big debate as to what defines actual, proper jazz vs. all the new wave, free jazz crap but I’ll define jazz as a music genre originating in African American communities in New Orleans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries developed from blues and ragtime.

Some might even say the sound is ""supersonic.""

nba,Why the Minnesota Timberwolves will go 72-0 in the 20-21 season and how they will beat every single team in the NBA.,"The Wolves are going to go 72-0 this season. You don't have to take my word for it, but luckily I have provided 29 (extremely statistically driven and accurate) reasons for why they will beat every single team in the NBA this season.


**Boston Celtics:** The Celtics were good last season, but unfortunately for them they now have Jeffrey Demarco Teague on their team. This will cause arguments between the team for 24 seconds on every offensive possession until it either results in a shot clock violation or last second heave which leaves a lot of room for the Wolves to come out on top.


**Brooklyn Nets:** With D'Angelo Russell, Ed Davis, and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson being ex-Nets players, the amount of turnovers by the Nets due to confusion on who their actual teammates are will be enough to push the Wolves over the top.


**New York Knicks:** It's the Knicks.


**Philadelphia 76ers:** This rejuvenated team from the city of brotherly love sadly has no pairs of brothers on the team together. This will inevitably cause the team to fail under the pressure of living up to their city name, which will provide a lackluster challenge that the Wolves can easily overcome.


**Toronto Raptors:** With the Raptors moving to Tampa for this season, the north is left uncontested to the Wolves. With their slogan ""We The North"" being rendered useless, they will falter under the realization that the Wolves slogan ""All Eyes North"" is now the only geographically correct slogan out of the two, allowing the Wolves to easily claim victory.


**Chicago Bulls:** The Bulls are from the Windy City, but unfortunately for them the Wolves are from the Twin Cities. Since 2 is more than 1, the Wolves easily win due to the sheer difference in the number of cities representing their team.


**Cleveland Cavaliers:** While MVP caliber player Thon Maker will be a tough challenge to overcome, the Cavaliers' brain damage from trying to read the font on their new city edition jerseys will lower the competition enough to propel the Wolves to a smooth win.


**Detroit Pistons:** With no sense of direction in their front office, the Pistons will also have no sense of direction on the court, causing them to score at least 20 points per game on the wrong goal. This opens up a wide point differential that will result in an easy win for the Wolves.


**Indiana Pacers:** It's no surprise that Oladipo constantly talks about ""wanting to play for the other team"", but when the Wolves and Pacers meet up he will take it a step further by ACTUALLY playing for the other team. This causes a 6v4 at all times that leads to an absolute domination of the Oladipo-less Indiana Pacers.


**Milwaukee Bucks:** The Bucks no longer have Robin Lopez, who most likely left because he was fearful of being dunked on by Jarrett ""I'm Like That"" Culver again. When Culver and the Bucks meet, they will be scared of him enough to leave the paint wide open, which avoids all potential posters, but also leaves the Wolves wide open to score easy layups and take control of the entire game.


**Atlanta Hawks:** In order to beat the Hawks, the Wolves need to arrange a motivational speech for the team from an Atlanta Falcons player ahead of time. By following the instructions and recommendations of the Falcons, the Hawks will completely give up in the 4th quarter and allow the Wolves to score as much as they want. This renders the other three quarters of the game essentially useless, which allows the Wolves to save energy for the absolute massacre of points that they will drop in the 4th, ending in a Wolves win.


**Charlotte Hornets:** When Michael Jordan sees the Wolves' two max contracts compared to the Hornets' one max contract, he will take it personally since he has to be #1 at everything. In an attempt to top the Wolves in this category, he will trade a majority of the roster mid game in order to make enough cap room to sign two bad players on max contracts. This will leave the Hornets severely undermanned and end in a Wolves win, but at least Jordan can have the moral victory of having more max contracts than the Wolves.


**Miami Heat:** While wearing their new ""Trix Yogurt"" city edition jerseys, Jimmy Butler will be reminded of the times he used to eat Trix Yogurt and String Cheese together as a kid. As the word ""String"" continuously repeats in his mind, he will also remember the time when he beat the Wolves in practice with the 3rd stringers. In an arrogant attempt to humiliate the Wolves, he will request that the coach only plays him and the Heat's 3rd stringers for the rest of the game. This will wildly backfire against the Wolves' new and improved team and ultimately lose the Heat the game.


**Orlando Magic:** The Magic made a huge mistake this season by not drafting rapper Sheck Wes to create an all-time duo with Mo Bamba. This will obviously create a significant lack of hoes calling the players' phones, therefore creating a large amount of loneliness among the Magic. This allows the chemistry-driven Wolves to achieve an easy victory.


**Washington Wizards:** While the loss of John Wall is unfortunate for the Wizards, there will still be another wall on the court. By using all of the bricks that Russell Westbrook puts up in order to create a brick wall for defense, the Wolves can essentially hold the Wizards to 0 points for the rest of the game since there is no way to get the ball around it. By creating any type of point differential before the wall is built, the Wolves can hold the score for the rest of the game and finish with a win.


**Denver Nuggets:** This one is simple. As long as there isn't both a 3 and a 1 on the scoreboard at the same time, the Wolves will have an easy time winning. In order to accomplish this, the Wolves may have to score on themselves multiple times a game and miss free throws on purpose, but by not allowing the Nuggets to get that 3-1 mentality, there is a 0% chance that they win.


**Oklahoma City Thunder:** The Thunder lose simply due to the fact that they won't even be able to remember who is on their team every week when another player gets traded for a pick. This confusion and lack of chemistry will lead the Thunder to many losses during the season, including the ones to the Wolves.


**Portland Trail Blazers:** The NBA halftime show rap battle between Anthony ""Lil Baby"" Edwards and Damian ""DAME D.O.L.L.A"" Lillard will gain enough attention from the Blazers' players to distract them long enough for the Wolves to score many times against an open court, leading them to an opposition-less victory.


**Utah Jazz:** With Anthony Edwards' favorite artist being Lil Baby, KAT's favorite artist being Mac Miller, and Josh Okogie's favorite artist being Young Thug, the rap-loving Wolves will play their favorite music throughout the entire game in order to prove how much they collectively hate jazz music. This extra motivation would be enough to lead any team to a win, and in this specific matchup, the Wolves will come out with an astounding victory.


**Golden State Warriors:** Wiggins' revenge game may seem like a scary thought to some, but through his charismatic delusions of ""I gained weight and improved my handle this offseason"", the Warriors will run the ball through Wiggins on every single play, leading to them only scoring inefficient points. This will allow the Wolves not only to outscore the Warriors, but also play amazing defense towards their very predictable offensive scheme.


**LA Clippers:** With the Clippers' chemistry issues, the Wolves won't even have to try in order to win this one. With Kawhi and Paul George causing issues in the locker room due to their diva egos, coupled with the fact that Clippers coach Ty Lue won't be able to remember the names of his players in order to call plays, the Wolves will have a smooth sailing victory past their disgruntled team.


**Los Angeles Lakers:** The Lakers are a tough team to beat, but the answer to beating them involves a psychological attack on the team. By having Wolves fans spam the DMs and Tweets of Lakers players with ""Mickey Mouse Ring"", the Lakers will be unable to focus on the game and instead question whether the 2019-2020 season ring counts or not. This mass hysteria will stay with the Lakers for the whole season, allowing the Wolves to pass them with ease.


**Phoenix Suns:** Even though the New Valley Boyz have reinforced their roster by adding Chris Paul, they have taken a step back by losing their two best looking players in Kelly Oubre and Ricky Rubio. With the addition of Rubio to the Wolves, there is now a disproportionate amount of good looking NBA players between the teams, which we can assume gives the Wolves a clear win in this matchup due to all of the swooning that will be coming from the Suns and distracting them throughout the match.


**Sacramento Kings:** While De'Aaron Fox is a shining light for the Kings organization, they also have coach Luke Walton who seems to be weary about starting his best players. If the trend continues forward throughout the season, the Wolves may find themselves facing an entire lineup of G-Leaguers for the majority of the game, which will be a simple task for them to overcome.


**Dallas Mavericks:** The path to beating the Mavericks comes through ownership. With Glen Taylor on his way to sell the team, the Wolves need to formulate a plan. In order to do this, Glen should cooperate with Mark Cuban throughout the process in order to make the Wolves even better. Before Mark leaves Dallas, he can force the front office to trade Luka to the Wolves for dirt cheap and then sell ownership of the Mavericks for full price while simultaneously buying the Wolves for a discount. By doing this he not only makes a ton of money, but he also creates a superteam in Minnesota while essentially crippling the Mavericks. Without Luka the Mavericks don't stand a chance against the Wolves and their newly formed dynasty.


**Houston Rockets:** By the time the Wolves land in Houston the Rockets already know that they have lost. Behind the insane defense of Josh ""Literally James Harden's Father"" Okogie, the Rockets are unable to run the ball through Harden. Additionally, with the loss of one of their best defenders in Robert Covington, all is hopeless for the Rockets as they are completely demolished on defense and Josh Okogie once again proves why James Harden cannot compete on the same level as him.


**Memphis Grizzlies:** The strategy to defeat the Grizzlies lies in the name of their best player. By rearranging the letters in Ja Morant you can form the words ""Jam Or Ant"". By showing this to Anthony Edwards, he is then extremely offended by being compared to jam. After he builds up all of his anger, he will then unleash an onslaught of offense on the Grizzlies and overwhelm them by beating Wilt's NBA record of 100 points. This will obviously result in a Wolves win due to the insane score differential at the end.


**New Orleans Pelicans:** In order to beat the Pelicans, the Wolves need to really give the players what they want. By placing a plate of fresh New Orleans cooking as well as a newly rolled blunt on the sidelines after every timeout, the Pelicans' star players Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram will be so attracted by the objects waiting for them that they will simply walk off of the court mid game in order to sit down and enjoy themselves. This will create a huge opening in the now 3v5 game that the Wolves can take advantage of and use to glide to victory.


**San Antonio Spurs:** The Spurs are led by veterans LaMarcus Aldridge and DeMar DeRozan. By forcing those two players to foul out of the game extremely early, all-time coach Greg Popovich is forced to check himself into the game and provide veteran leadership for the rest of the young squad. While Popovich has proven to be a great coach, he will be a significant liability for the Spurs on the court, basically creating a 4v5 situation for the Wolves to capitalize on and eventually win the game.

nba,and the results are in for... the LEAST Valuable Player,"While the media may focus on the MVP award and other prestigious honors, reddit has the distinct honor of awarding the LVP [trophy](https://www.buyawardsandtrophies.com/holiday-awards/halloween-trophies/worst-costume-toilet-trophy). **The LEAST Valuable Player**. It's a tradition that dates back to 2017, with [Monta Ellis](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/64yxyp/forget_mvp_who_should_win_least_valuable_player/) winning the trophy in what would be his last year in the league. [Jamal Crawford](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8ai7pl/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/) won the following year when his defense had soured past the point of no return. [Solomon Hill](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/b8xut2/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/) won in 2019, starting games for a then-imploding Pelicans team (during the AD drama). [Isaiah Thomas](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hukwu8/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/) won in 2020 for a short stint with the Wizards, and [Aron Baynes](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nhp7j2/and_the_results_are_in_for_the_least_valuable/) won last season after struggling as a starter for Toronto.

Who will join that illustrious list? Before we get to that, let's remember the criteria and caveats:

--- Obviously, the worst players in the league are the ones who sit at the end of the bench and don't get any playing time. However, this award focuses on players who log a decent amount of minutes and consequently affected their team's play the most. Simply put: the more you play, the more damage you can do. 

--- And that actual ""damage"" is important. If you're on a tanking team, no one cares about your poor play; it may even be a positive. We also tend to ignore young players (under 21) who are still developing and can't be expected to be solid players yet.

--- Similarly, we don't want to judge players within the context of their salary any more than the actual MVP does. We also do not weigh in injuries either. We want to focus on players' on-court performance instead. Those rules (which has existed since the beginning of the LVP award) may be especially controversial this year.

--- We also wanted to note that this yearly column can come across as a little mean spirited, which is not our intention. Even the worst player in the NBA is in the top 99% percentile at their sport and making more money than most of us could dream about. And to be fair, even the worst player in the league probably costs his team only a couple of games (hardly anyone has a VORP worse than -2), so they shouldn't be the scapegoat for an entire organization. In many cases, they're simply played too much or played in the wrong role. But when the stakes are this high, it's fair to criticize players or their teams for that negative impact.

So with all that said, let's take a look at the dishonorable mentions and the official top 5.

---

######**(DIS)HONORABLE MENTION: FALLEN STAR EDITION**

**PG Ben Simmons, PHI/BKN: 0.0 minutes per game, n/a BPM**

The LVP headquarters has made a rule to discount any injuries, but that still leaves the matter of Ben Simmons up for debate. How much do you believe in mental health as an excused absence? How much do you believe in the severity and timing of his back injury? It's difficult to give concrete answers to that; I imagine most older folks would call him ""soft"" while many younger fans would give him the benefit of the doubt. At the end of the day, we'll reluctantly avoid tagging him with the trophy; we're not a big enough organization to fight a Rich Paul lawsuit.

---

**PG Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn: 37.2 minutes per game, +2.7 BPM**

Kyrie Irving's decision to avoid a vaccine had massive ramifications. If he got the jab, would James Harden have stuck around? Would Kevin Durant have stayed healthy (if he didn't have to overextend his minutes)? Would Brooklyn have fulfilled expectations as the preseason title favorites? It's hard to know. And it's hard to know the inner workings of Kyrie Irving's not-so-beautiful mind. Still, at the end of the day, Irving was willing to play basketball if the local rules allowed, so it's hard to fault him more than other players who also remained unvaccinated. He's also -- like him or not -- really F'ing good at basketball. To that end: his BPM (box plus minus, meant to illustrate a player's impact per 100 possessions) is easily the highest on our list.

---

**PF Julius Randle, N.Y. Knicks: 35.3 minutes per game, +0.5 BPM**

In our original straw poll, some people mentioned Julius Randle's dud season as a potential LVP campaign. And sure enough, both Randle and the Knicks were big disappointments. After signing a big extension, Randle's shooting dropped like a rock (from 41% to 31% from deep) and the Knicks dropped out of the playoffs with him. Still, he doesn't really qualify for this particular award. While overpaid, he's still a solid starting player. In fact, *last* season was probably more of an outlier than anything else based on his career numbers.

---

######**(DIS)HONORABLE MENTION: OTHER DISAPPOINTMENTS WHO DON'T FIT THE BILL**

**C Mason Plumlee, Charlotte: 24.6 minutes per game, +0.0 BPM**

After years and years of Cody Zeller, the Charlotte Hornets finally moved on. But alas, their heart couldn't move on entirely, so they rebounded with *another* white dude who happened to be the best of his three brothers; it was the NBA equivalent of Rachel dating [Russ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9-hJD_9Qkw).

Plumlee started 73 games for Charlotte, and promptly reminded everyone why he's best served as a backup instead. His 39.2% shooting from the free throw line was particularly ugly. All that said, Plumlee isn't a *bad* player and has some virtues (primarily his passing). If this award was limited to the worst *starters*, then Mason Plumlee would have a good chance at qualifying. But since we open it to all rotational players, he gets a pass here.

---

**PF Davis Bertans, WAS/DAL: 14.4 minutes per game, -2.6 BPM**

We want to reiterate that LVP doesn't factor in salary. And that fact may spare the Latvian legend, Davis Bertans. When Bertans first came into the NBA, he was under the radar and turned out to be a bargain signing for Washington. He splashed over 40% of his threes his first two years for the team, giving them some valuable spacing at the PF position. Unfortunately, the Wizards got a little *too* excited about it and gave Bertans a long-term extension. It was a risky proposition given his one-dimensional skill set and his extensive injury history (two ACL tears.) 

In hindsight, it's one of the worst contracts in recent memory. Bertans was absolutely brutal this season for Washington, hitting only 31.9% of his threes and looking stiffer than a corpse on D. New coach Wes Unseld (a defensive specialist) deemed him virtually unplayable, giving him 0 starts and under 15 minutes a night before the team dumped him on Dallas. Oddly enough, the fact that Bertans didn't play much for Washington may help him in LVP voting as the team minimized his negative impact. He also played better in Dallas, due no doubt to Luka Doncic's gravity and playmaking.

---

**SG Talen Horton-Tucker, L.A. Lakers: 25.2 minutes per game, -3.3 BPM**

It's debatable whether or not Talen Horton-Tucker should qualify for LVP voting or not. In his defense, he's still only 21 years old (and thus should be spared by our age rule.) At the same time, he's already in his third year in the league, and he's already making $9.5M a year. Famously, the Lakers even prioritized him over some of their other vets. When they did that, the expectation was that he could be a contributor for the team's title push this year. 

Turns out: he could not. THT's best virtue is his length when he slashes inside as a scorer, but he rarely gets the chance to do that when he's on the court with LeBron James and Russell Westbrook. With them, he has to play off the ball and chuck up threes, which isn't his strong suit (27% on the year.) Despite the clunky fit, the Lakers still played him 25+ minutes a game and gave him 19 spot starts. 

---

######**(DIS)HONORABLE MENTION: END OF THE ROAD EDITION**

**SG Lou Williams, Atlanta: 14.3 minutes per game, -3.4 BPM**

Sweet Lou Williams fits the mold of a lot of our former LVP winners (Monta Ellis, Jamal Crawford, Isaiah Thomas.) They're best known as microwave scorers, but there becomes a point when the machine starts to malfunction and the warranty runs out on the equipment. And when the scoring stops, the other limitations to their game become more obvious and problematic.

Williams probably dipped into the ""negative"" camp last season, and he's been sinking even lower now (at age 35.) He's no longer an efficient scorer -- he's no longer getting to the line (1.4 FTA per game) -- he's no longer playable. He's spared from ranking higher on this list due to the fact that Nate McMillan realized that and kept him under 15 minutes a night.

---

**C DeAndre Jordan, LAL/PHI: 13.0 minutes per game, -1.4 BPM**

DeAndre Jordan doesn't fit the mold of the old microwave scorer, but he's another former star who's stumbled over the hill. Sometimes, the most dangerous players aren't the bad ones -- they're the ones who used to be good. And because of their reputation, they end up overstaying their welcome. 

That describes Jordan this season, one in which he somehow found playing time for two separate teams. He started 19 games for the Lakers, and then took over Andre Drummond's backup role in Philly. And while we may lump Drummond and Jordan together as two classic bigs who don't fit the modern NBA, there's a notable gap between them of terms of age (Drummond is 5 years younger) and quality of play. In fact, Drummond graded as over 4 points better per 100 possessions in the same role (Drummond at +1.3, Jordan at -3.0). 

Sidenote: the playoffs did not affect his candidacy ; as with MVP, the LVP is a *regular season* award. That said, Sixers fans may hope that Doc Rivers reads reddit.

**PF James Johnson, Brooklyn: 19.2 minutes per game, -2.2 BPM**

The Brooklyn Nets signed ""Bloodsport"" as a defender and enforcer, figuring they'd be all set on offense. After all, they had Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Joe Harris, Patty Mills, etc. What could go wrong??

Turns out: a lot. And given all the injuries and absences, the Nets needed more from a rotation player and spot starter (10 starts) than Johnson was able to provide. He's never been a good offensive player (aside from one outlier shooting season in Miami), but he dipped down to 27% from deep this season despite a lot of easy and open shots. Johnson's defense -- now at age 35 -- can't make up for his other limitations. Ultimately, the Nets cut their losses and waived Johnson this past month. It's rare for a team to cut a veteran right before a playoff run, a move that speaks volumes about how much they thought he had left to offer. (Although in hindsight, they may have regretted downsizing against Boston.)

######**(DIS)HONORABLE MENTION: BOTTOM OF THE BARREL EDITION**

**SF Semi Ojeleye, MIL/LAC: 13.5 minutes per game, -3.1 BPM**

After four forgettable years in Boston, Semi Ojeleye had his worst season yet in shared time with Milwaukee and L.A. He was arguably one of the worst players in the entire league this year, shooting just 30% from the field and not contributing much else. All that said, Ojeleye doesn't quite fit the bill for what we're looking for here; his 406 total minutes don't represent enough playing time to be a huge impact. Still -- make no mistake -- Ojeleye needs to find his footing fast before he falls out of the league.

---

**SG Keljin Blevins, Portland: 9.0 minutes per game, -7.5 BPM**

Best known as Damian Lillard's cousin and nepotism signing, Keljin Blevins is making a name for himself as one of the worst players in NBA history. Similar to Semi Ojeleye, Blevins won't qualify for this award because he hardly played until the team started to tank. Still, he deserves a (dis)honorable mention given his grisly numbers. He's shot 31% from the field, 29% from 3, and 55% from the line for a grand total of a 41% true shooting. Add in the fact that he's undersized for SF (where he played most of his minutes), and it's arguable that Blevins is a historically bad player. 

In fact, it's pretty egregious that the Blazers gave him a contract in the first place. Even in college, Blevins didn't stand out. He averaged 11.8 points per game as a fifth-year senior, the third highest total on a Montana State team that went 15-17 overall. There's almost no chance that a player with that resume would sniff the NBA if he didn't score highly on his 23-and-me test.

######**THE OFFICIAL LIST: THE TOP 5 ""LEAST VALUABLE PLAYERS""**

**(5) SG Furkan Korkmaz, Philadelphia: 21.1 minutes per game, -3.1 BPM**

The absence of Ben Simmons opened up minutes and opportunities for other players. Some (like Tyrese Maxey) took advantage. Some (like Furkan Korkmaz) pooped the bed instead.

The fact that Korkmaz averaged a career-high 20+ minutes a game says more about the Sixers' depth than about his play on the court. Defensively, Korkmaz is limited (as illustrated by his -1.1 BPM), so his chief contributions come as a shooter/spacer. Unfortunately, the Turkish sharpshooter forgot his rifle this year. He hit 28.9% of his threes, which is an especially low mark for someone who plays next to offensive stars. Korkmaz's struggles also grade highly in terms of the ""impact"" on the season. If the Sixers were ONE game better (which Korkmaz could have provided), they'd have the # 2 seed instead of the # 4. To be fair, Korkmaz has been better in the past, so we shouldn't be so quick to write off his future. 2021-22 was simply a year to forget for him.

**(4) SG Nickeil Alexander-Walker, NO/UTA: 22.6 minutes per game, -2.9 BPM**

In my preseason ""best bet"" series, I did a decent job predicting some awards, including [Tyler Herro](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ph5khd/oc_the_best_bet_series_predicting_the_sixth_man/) as the Sixth Man of the Year. But for [Most Improved](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/p9zjdh/oc_the_best_bet_series_predicting_the_most/
) I veered off course so badly that I accidentally recreated [Mac and Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5le9sYdYkM). Like many, I expected third-year guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker to have a breakout season.

Most damningly of all, so did David Griffin and the New Orleans Pelicans. Alexander-Walker projected as a potential scorer given his size and slashing capability (reminiscent of his cousin Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.) Allegedly, Griffin made the idea of giving Alexander-Walker more playing time a focal point of his coaching search. They even deemed Lonzo Ball expendable. It was NAW's time to shine! And did he? NAW.

Alexander-Walker had a golden opportunity early in the season with Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram out, and the Pelicans gave him every chance to show his scoring chops. He started their first 18 games, and jacked up 20+ shots three separate times. Effectively, he was their go-to guy. The problem is: NAW couldn't hit a bucket or finish at the rim. He shot 37% from the field and 29% from 3 in that time, one of the key reasons the team got off to such a terrible 3-15 start. 

The Pelicans eventually benched (and then traded) NAW, and eventually they found their footing when Brandon Ingram came back and C.J. McCollum arrived from Portland. They even rallied to make the playoffs. By doing that, they may have sunk NAW's LVP campaign. And in his defense, he's still a young player (age 23) who got thrust into the spotlight too early due to injuries and poor roster planning. Hopefully he'll be able to find his rhythm in a year or two and avoid making lists like these.

**(3) PG Avery Bradley, L.A. Lakers: 22.7 minutes per game, -3.6 BPM**

There's been plenty of blame to go around for the Lakers' struggles this year, but I haven't seen much of it directed at Avery Bradley, who started 45/62 games. Bradley's been holding on to his reputation as a solid 3+D guard for a while now -- but he hasn't been particularly effective at it since his days in Boston. 

While Bradley can still hit some open shots (39% from 3), he's not the easiest player to fit in a lineup. Because he acts more as a spacer than playmaker (0.8 assists per game), he really needs to be the de facto PG for a team with a big point forward. LeBron James qualifies. Russell Westbrook, not as much. With Westbrook on the court, Bradley has to play ""up"" as a wing (79% of his minutes at SG, according to basketball-reference) and his limited size at 6'3"" becomes a problem. To make matters worse, the Lakers trotted out several 3 and even 4-guard lineups this year, which crushed them defensively. If we had an ""anti-award"" for worst GM, Rob Pelinka may be a lock.

---

**(2) PG Russell Westbrook, L.A. Lakers: 34.3 minutes per game, -1.6 BPM**

We've already mentioned three other Lakers (Avery Bradley, Talen Horton-Tucker, and DeAndre Jordan) and several others could have made the list as well. The roster was thinner than a Hollywood starlet all season long, and Frank Vogel didn't know how to patch them together in an appropriate way. 

No doubt, a lot of those problems are the trickle-down effect of their disastrous decision to go all in on Russell Westbrook and his $40M contract. He didn't fit with LeBron James, and he sapped up all the salary the team could have used on supplemental talent around them. 

In our straw poll, Westbrook was the overwhelming winner of this award. Still, here at the LVP headquarters, we've vowed not to factor in contracts. So the question becomes: was Russell Westbrook a *bad* player this year (ignoring salary)? You can definitely make that argument. He shot under 30% from 3 and under 67% from the line. He led the league in total turnovers (3.8 per game) and probably led the league in wild airballs as well. His freelancing also made him a bad defensive player (-0.9 BPM). He still has some virtues -- namely that he can put pressure on defenses in transition -- but they didn't make up for his shortcomings.

Despite all that and despite the [Viking](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-09/man-in-viking-garb-among-three-charged-by-u-s-in-capitol-riots) mob storming the gate demanding his blood, I fear that Westbrook is not *quite* bad enough for this award. He's been a below-average starter and probably a zero-value player (illustrated by his 0.2 VORP). Given his contract, that's a disaster. But if we ignore contracts as mandated, I don't think he's the worst of the worst. If anything, he'd inspire us to debate a change to the ""contract"" rule for the future.

---

**(1) PG Facundo Campazzo, Denver: 18.2 minutes per game, -0.8 BPM**

There's a tipping point where an amusing sidekick starts to get overexposed and becomes annoying: we call it the [Rob Schneider effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Schneider).

Denver guard Facundo Campazzo reached that point this season. He provided a little spark and energy in the past in a cameo role, but the Nugget needed more from him this year with Jamal Murray injured. Unfortunately, Campazzo came up short. Despite a boatload of open shots, he only hit 36% from the field and 30% from 3. His limited size (listed at 5'10"") makes it difficult for him to operate inside the arc either. He's feisty on D, but that's not enough to overcome his other limitations.

Campazzo's box plus/minus isn't terrible (-0.8), but the struggles go deeper than that. In our initial poll for this award, Nuggets fan /u/Kovovyev buried him with some brutal advanced stats. Apparently over 95% of his threes are classified as ""open"" or ""wide open"" by NBA.com, making that 31% success rate a remarkable failure. And despite playing on a good team, Campazzo registered a -8 net rating. He's even negative (-2) when playing alongside Nikola Jokic. Eventually the Nuggets shelved Campazzo, but he did play enough games to do his damage. 

How much ""damage"" is there? Arguably, not a huge amount since the Nuggets still won 48 games. Still, it shouldn't take a historically good year from your star player to make the playoffs -- and that's what Nikola Jokic had to do. In fact, of the 16 players who logged 100+ minutes for Denver, Jokic is the *only* one who had a positive BPM. The fact that the Nuggets couldn't count on the veteran Campazzo to soak up some minutes and stop that bleeding is a true knock against him.

So while Russell Westbrook got the most attention this year for his poor play, the LVP office would have to ask: which player would you rather have less? Who is the LEAST valuable/helpful? 35 minutes of Russ, or 20 minutes of Campazzo? It's not an easy decision.

In fact, the debate came down to the wire and the last day of the regular season, when Campazzo gave us the LVP version of a ""Heisman moment"" with a [cheap shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJPoI8fGyws) shove to Wayne Ellington. It was telling. After falling out of the rotation, Campazzo should have used the last day and garbage time to prove that he actually belonged in the NBA. He did the opposite. Many of our LVP ""winners"" ended up not playing in an NBA rotation again, and Campazzo (an impending free agent) may be next.",9141,849,2022-05-05,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uiye0u/and_the_results_are_in_for_the_least_valuable/

nba,Jaylen Brown’s recent IG post re: Twitter backlash,"Jaylen Brown posted this meme on his Instagram story amid the backlash and reactions to his recent Tweets and statements in support of Kyrie Irving.

[https://i.imgur.com/pXbHb6g.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/pXbHb6g.jpg)

What do you realistically think will come of this? I don’t see the Celtics organization doing anything unless he does something even more blatant.

Brown continues to disappoint Celtics fans with these antics and refusal to apologize and take ownership of his actions. I think that a lot of us (at least most of us on r/BostonCeltics) are pretty much fed up with it at this point.

Edit: For people unaware of why this meme has caused a reaction, here is the context for what has brought us to this point. 

1.	Kanye West comes under fire for antisemitic comments and for supporting an antisemitic book. West had recently opened up a school, Donda Academy. His Donda Academy sports teams have their games cancelled/banned due to the backlash/negative PR Kanye caused. Jaylen releases an official tweet cutting ties with Donda Sports, Kanye West’s marketing/talent agency he was signed to as a featured athlete. Shortly after this, Jaylen expresses his discontent at the student athletes of Donda Academy having their games cancelled/banned from venues due to the negative PR from Kanye. Donda Academy has since closed down. [(Tweets)](https://imgur.com/a/SqCeJB6) 
2.	Kyrie Irving of the Brooklyn Nets shares an antisemitic documentary on Twitter. The documentary included a mass Jewish conspiracy for world domination. Kanye West calls Kyrie “a real one”. The Brooklyn Nets suspend Kyrie and stipulate that he must fulfill a checklist of items before he can return to play. *The list:  1) Apologize and condemn the movie that he posted on his social media accounts. 2) Make $500,000 worth of donations to anti-hate causes. 3) Take sensitivity training. 4) Take antisemitism training. 5)  Meet with the Anti-Defamation League and Jewish leaders. 6)  Meet with Joe Tsai to demonstrate understanding of why his actions were wrong.* [Jaylen Brown took issue with this.](https://imgur.com/a/vuf8LUU)
3.	Kyrie Irving is set to return to the court to play after (I’m assuming) fulfilling Joe Tsai’s list. Jaylen Brown retweets a video of Black Hebrew Israelites chanting while in formation with the caption “Energy”. [(Tweet)](https://imgur.com/a/imE1dU1)  [(Tweet with video)](https://twitter.com/FCHWPO/status/1594458907883233280?s=20&amp;t=C6-NjMjjyYSu34qEVkvo4Q) This group was outside of Barclay’s arena showing support for Irving and handing out antisemitic propaganda. The Black Hebrew Israelites are a [recognized extremist hate group](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/black-hebrew-israelites) by the ADL. 
4.	Jaylen later says he didn’t know what group that was, and confused them with a fraternity. [(Tweets)](https://imgur.com/a/AP8uUtd)   Jaylen then went a step further and said he “didn’t have his reading glasses on” when making the tweet, and that he won’t delete any of the tweets because they’re in support of Kyrie Iriving.

nba,Which team is the worst at the NBA draft? Which team is the unluckiest? Which fanbase has suffered the most? Did Chris Bosh even really exist? I did the math. Find the answers to three of these questions in this post!,"# What did I do?

I went back through the last 30 drafts (Cade to Shaq) and compared every drafted player's VORP to the VORP of players drafted adjacent to them to calculate for **regret** (picking a dud one slot right before a stud) and for **misfortune** (missing out on a stud by one pick).

# Why should you not continue reading this?

So a number of limitations to cover first before we dive into the numbers.

1. I used VORP because it was convenient not necessarily because it was the best metric. This study is thus as reliable as you think VORP is. How reliable is VORP for this? Just know that Chauncey Billups (43.5) is ranked higher than Giannis (43.3) and decide for yourself.
2. This list is also stupid because it completely ignores sentiment. Per VORP, I should technically regret drafting JRich (23.8) instead of Shane Battier (28.2). While Shane's career was dandy, I promise you will not find any Warrior fan that would trade what we had with JRich. If you do find one, run and do not stop. You have just been conversing with a psychopath.
3. A better example of this is Paul Pierce. Are the Celtics unlucky for missing out on Dirk (84.8) and having to settle for Pierce (65.5) in 98? I think the only Massholes that would affirm that are likewise psychopaths.
4. We're trolling a bit here. Fourteen teams regret passing on Giannis after all, but in this model Utah gets assigned 100% of the regret because they were the very last pick before Giannis.
5. This doesn't account for off-court stuff. IIRC, Kobe fell in 96 because his agent made it clear he would only play for a big market team. Technically, we shouldn't fault Cleveland more than the other 11 teams that passed on him, but we're airing dirty laundry here and a soiled Vitaly Potapenko is too good to not show off.
6. I couldn't keep track of trades, so I used original team slots unless otherwise noted below. It makes for very inconsistent logic and arguments. For example, I have PHI regretting passing on Dirk even though MIL probably would regret trading him even more.
7. As a dumb Californian who thinks everything east of Texas is either New York or Florida, I apologize, I could not fucking keep track of the New Orleans and Charlotte franchises. Picks are tied to the city and not the franchise.
8. Finally, I did this as a passion project late at night when my kids went to sleep. Yes, I'm a fucking loser. Hold the applause. A lot of the work was done after I blazed a bunch of trees like I was a goddamn California wildfire. There are probably errors. Bless you for finding them.

With all that out of the way...

# The Eleven Most Regretful Picks

Regret Index is calculated as the VORP of a player selected minus the VORP of the player selected right after. It's a measure of how much a team's pick outperformed the player picked right after him.

|Pick|Year|Pick|Team|Next Pick|Regret Index|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|12|1996|Vitaly Potapenko|CLE|Kobe Bryant|\-86.0|
|1|2007|Greg Oden|POR|Kevin Durant|\-75.6|
|8|1998|Larry Hughes|PHI|Dirk Nowitzki|\-74.1|
|2|2009|Hasheem Thabeet|MEM|James Harden|\-72.4|
|3|2005|Deron Williams|UTA|Chris Paul|\-65.4|
|6|2009|Jonny Flynn|MIN|Steph Curry|\-62.8|
|1|1994|Glenn Robinson|MIL|Jason Kidd|\-60.0|
|4|1995|Rasheed Wallace|WSB|Kevin Garnett|\-58.6|
|8|1997|Adonal Foyle|GSW|Tracy McGrady|\-54.6|
|3|2008|O.J. Mayo|MIN|Russell Westbrook|\-51.1|
|56|1999|Tim Young|GSW|Manu Ginóbili|\-47.7|

A few notes:

* CLE gets shit on for having the most regretful pick of all time, here but my Warriors actually had the 11th pick that year and we took Todd Fuller who was actually WORSE than Potapenko. I still remember this vividly to this day. Maybe even more so than my own wedding day. Do Cavs fans feel similar pain?
* Oden is a good example of injuries rendering this exercise meaningless. Yes, I suppose POR regrets passing on Durant given what we all know now, but Oden was the consensus #1 pick since birth. Hard to fault them back then. Still gotta live with the regret I guess...
* Who regrets the 98 draft more, PHI for passing on Dirk or MIL for trading him?
* DWill and CP3 were neck and neck for awhile. I'm surprised to see their gap in VORP this large. Testament to CP3's longevity and indictment of DWill's.
* Should MIN's regret index for passing on Steph be multiplied by 2?
* I was there when we picked Adonal Foyle over TMac. Still hurts...
* I didn't know what to do with the Mayo trade. Technically, the trade was after the draft concluded so by the logic of this model, MIN regrets passing on Westbrook. However, they ended up getting Kevin Love, and I doubt there's much regret there at all. MEM on the other hand got the shit end of the stick, so I broke the rules and forced all the regret on their plate.
* I didn't know I regretted passing on Manu until today. So that's why it's a top eleven and not a top ten.

# The Eleven Unluckiest Picks

The misfortune index is calculated as the VORP of the player selected minus the player selected right before him. It's a measure of how much a team's pick outperformed the player picked right before him.

&amp;#x200B;

|Pick|Year|Pick|Team|Prior Pick|Misfortune Index|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|2003|Darko Miličić|DET|LeBron James|\-143.5|
|6|1995|Bryant Reeves|VAN|Kevin Garnett|\-101.2|
|5|2005|Raymond Felton|CHA|Chris Paul|\-83.6|
|2|1997|Keith Van Horn|PHI|Tim Duncan|\-81.5|
|6|2003|Chris Kaman|LAC|Dwyane Wade|\-62.4|
|8|2009|Jordan Hill|NYK|Steph Curry|\-60.9|
|4|2009|Tyreke Evans|SAC|James Harden|\-58.9|
|4|2001|Eddy Curry|CHI|Pau Gasol|\-58.8|
|10|1997|Danny Fortson|MIL|Tracy McGrady|\-58.3|
|11|1998|Bonzi Wells|DET|Paul Pierce|\-57.2|
|6|1998|Robert Traylor|MIL|Vince Carter|\-57.2|

* IIRC, that Piston's pick they used on Darko was top-1 protected, so they had no shot at LeBron anyways. If anything they had extreme fortune in getting a #2 pick the year after they won. So while they technically shouldn't be counted as having the unluckiest pick, they can keep the ignominy because they wasted it on Darko.
* Van Horn was traded to the Nets on draft night, but I'm leaving PHI in this slot to emphasize how close they were to Duncan.
* Technically, it was DAL that barely missed out on Air Canada, but they traded that pick to MIL for Dirk, so Milwaukee gets credited the misfortune. What an all around shitty draft for them that year.
* Not so fun fact: I owned a Danny Fortson jersey at one point in my life. He was the Warrior's best hope once upon a time.

* NOP has drafted with the least regret in the last 30 years with their picks outperforming the next selection by an average of +4.470 in VORP.
* UTA has filled their fans with the most regret, with their picks underperforming the very next pick by 2.524.
* Vince Carter goes to the Warriors All-Regret team despite being drafted by them. That's because the Warriors flipped him to TOR as soon as the pick was made. I can attest. Still very regrettable to this day.
* Ray Allen ends up on MIN's list despite being drafted by them for the same reasons. He was flipped to MIL for Stephon Marbury on draft day.
* SAS could've had Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler in the same draft. They took Cory Joseph one pick ahead of Jimmy Butler. That would've been a wild duo.
* Exactly half the league has been more regretful than league average. That's UTA, LAC, MIL, MEM, PHI, WAS, POR, ATL, CHI, NYK, MIN, SAC, GSW, DET, CHA.
* Some honorable mentions for All-Regret teams. Lamelo Ball (GSW), Jaylen Brown (LAL), DeAndre Jordan (MIN), Devin Booker (UTA)

* The league average for Misfortune/Pick (how much a pick outperforms the player selected right before) is coincidentally -0.415. Well, not coincidence. That's how inverses work. One team's regret is another team's fortune.
* MEM has been the unluckiest, missing out on greatness by one pick more so than any other franchise. In 95 they settled on Big Country after MIN picked KG one pick ahead. That was a -101.2 VORP swing, second largest in the last 30 years. In 09, they picked Hasheem Thabeet right after Blake Griffin, a -32.9 swing. And while the jury's still out on JJJ, missing on Luka by one slot has cost a -17.0 drop in VORP so far.
* OKC has drafted better than the team one pick ahead more often than other teams. Durant after Oden in 07 (+75.6 in VORP), Westbrook after Mayo in 08 (+51.1), and Harden after Thabeet in 09 (+72.4) remains stuff of legends.
* 18 teams are unluckier than league average. They include MEM,LAC, CHA, MIA, NYK, DET, BOS, MIL, NOP, MIN, UTA, ORL, ATL, SAC, CLE, CHI, WAS, PHI.
* Although TOR was unlucky to miss out on Iverson, league rules precluded expansion teams from winning the #1 pick in the lottery for the first 3 years. So technically, they were never that close.
* Charlotte has picked second, thrice after a generational big man went first. They picked Zo after Shaq in 92 (-48.1), Emeka after Dwight in 04 (-32.2), and MKG after AD in 12 (-41.5). Gives me irrational confidence about Wiseman.
* Somehow, Chicago managed to pick right after both Gasol brothers.
* Other honorable mentions: LaMarcus Aldridge (CHA), Yao Ming (CHI), Donovan Mitchell (MIA), Ja Morant (NYK), Julius Randle (SAC), Myles Turner (UTA)

# Other bits and bobs

* Chris Bosh is the top player in no man's land. Carmelo went right before him and has a higher VORP so DEN has no regrets about Bosh. DWade went right after and also has a higher VORP, so MIA does not consider itself unlucky. Does Chris Bosh even really exist? I dunno...
* The next player on this list is Peja Stojaković. Drafted 14th, he was sandwiched in between the selections of Kobe and Steve Nash.
* Al Jefferson is the top player who had the same team regret passing on him that was also so close to getting him. In 04, UTA picked the first Kardashian curse 14th and Kirk Snyder at 16. Al Jefferson outperformed both after being picked 15th.
* I was there for the 2000 draft class. I think everyone regrets making a pick that year.
* DET had consecutive picks in 93. They went with Lindsey Hunter at 10 and Allan Houston at 11. The latter had the better career, so technically the team that regrets passing on Allan Houston is also the team that picked him? It's like when Fry finds out he's his own grandpa!

# Bring the pain!

The Regret Index is a measure of how much each team's front office works through the draft to fuck over their own fanbase. The Misfortune Index is a measure of how much the universe conspires to fuck over a fanbase. Combining the two yields the ultimate in pain. A menage-a-trois of utter disappointment and despair. So which fanbase can claim to be the most fucked over the last 30 years?

And there you have it. UTA comes in third at delivering the most pain to their fans through the NBA draft. If ""name the player selected right before Giannis in 13"" ever comes up in your pub trivia, now you know the answer is Jazz legend Shabazz Muhammad.

MEM comes in second, though I'm guessing most current Grizz fans don't give a shit some Canadian team picked a Big Country over a Big Ticket once upon a time.  Besides, I'm one that believes the Zion-Ja-RJ selections will break most favorably to MEM over the long run.

Finally congratulations Clipbros! You have suffered the most pain in the NBA draft over the last 30 years according to VORP. Just look at the fucking team you can assemble with players either picked directly before or after the Clippers picked. Baron Davis, Dwyane Wade, Gordon Hayward, Pau Gasol, and Amar'e Stoudemire.

nba,The Brooklyn Nets are 20-5 in their last 25 games!,"All the talk about the WL records of Toronto, Milwaukee and the Golden State Warriors but the Brooklyn Nets have been an outright elite team for the last 25 games.  
  
I'm really enjoying watching the team this season and its been a super impressive stretch of play after a 7-18 start to the season. Players like Harris, D'Lo and Dinwiddie are quickly becoming some of my favourites and I hope they continue this run and qualify for the playoffs. Must be awesome for Nets fans to experience such a great run of form. The team has experienced so much adversity with devastating injuries and continue to charge forward.  
  
**EDIT:**  As a reference here are others teams WL records in their past 25 games:  

Milwaukee, 19-6  
Golden State, 19-6

nba,"[Winfield] Durant became frustrated with Simmons, who has received more lenience in a shorter period of time than Irving, despite providing significantly less production in his minutes on the floor.","&gt; It was the Nets, not Irving, who decided the star guard shouldn’t be around the team for road games or home practices up until the moment the virus ravaged the NBA, including 13 Nets players who were sent into the league’s health and safety protocols at the same time. Prior to that outbreak, the Nets played a hard line with the superstar, who was eligible for most road games and could have kept the team on a trajectory toward championship contention. But when the situation became too inconvenient, the team ultimately folded.

&gt; That’s one of three examples, according to a source familiar with Irving’s thinking, of the “disrespect” the star guard described to Dallas media in his introductory press conference on Tuesday.

&gt; Irving was also put off by the wording in the statement the Nets issued when they suspended him a total of eight games for posting the link to a film widely considered antisemitic on his social media feeds.

&gt; The organization used the words “unfit to be associated with the Brooklyn Nets” for a player whose talent transcended basketball. Irving has Jewish family members and claims to have posted the link in search of his own family history. Everyone he spoke with in the aftermath of the incident, including Nets owner Joe Tsai, said they did not believe Irving was antisemitic. That much is true. In speaking carefully and delicately to appease Irving in private but taking a hardline in the statement to appease the public, the Nets tried to have it both ways.

&gt; And then there was the charade that followed last season’s four-game sweep at the hands of the Boston Celtics.

&gt; Irving proclaimed he wanted to “co-manage the franchise” with Tsai and general manager Sean Marks, words that drew criticism from some both within the organization and the Nets fan base due to his pattern of unavailability through his first few seasons in Brooklyn.

&gt; A week later, Marks — twice in the same week — suggested the Nets weren’t sold on a long-term future with Irving, that the team only wanted players who were fully committed to being available in Brooklyn.

&gt; It was an understandable response, given the rancor Irving had already inflicted at the time. It was also a sign that the Nets were completely ill-equipped to deal with the personalities who had chosen to occupy their arena. They had just elected to trade Harden rather than try to win him over, and here was Marks impotently implying that the team might move from Irving rather than deal with the headache, thereby adding to the headache he was implicitly criticizing. Toxic relationships can do that to people.

&gt; All the while, Durant had been monitoring the situation.

&gt; Durant was frustrated by the trade that sent Harden to Philadelphia for Ben Simmons, Seth Curry and Andre Drummond. Specifically, he became frustrated with Simmons, who has received more lenience in a shorter period of time than Irving, despite providing significantly less production in his minutes on the floor.

&gt; Simmons, very obviously, is not a player for right now. And the Nets’ investment into him during the twilight of Durant’s prime is the sort of hedging typically reserved for a team like the Warriors, which has already demonstrated it works at the championship level, not one like the Nets, struggling to make it work at all. As with the flip-flop on Irving’s vaccination and the mixed messages of his suspension, the Nets were trying to live in two worlds at once without ever committing to either.

&gt; On the whole, Durant was put off by Marks, who remains Nets GM despite Durant’s request he be fired this offseason. With Marks’ penchant for finding gems in the draft, and the Nets’ now-loaded treasure trove of seven first-round picks in the upcoming draft classes, it’s hard to envision him parting from his post.

Gee I wonder who this guy’s sources are lol

nba,"[NBA Draft History] Best players from every draft slot, from 60th to 1st.","Took all the feedback/ criticism into account and made some revisions. Some people requested a list from 60 through 1, so I did my best. It also took a long fucking time.

60) Isaiah Thomas, I just straight up love this dude, RIP to his sister Chyna who passed away tragically. At 5'9, the guy was an absolute machine and made Boston fans rejoice untio, well... let's leave it there. One love to IT.

59) Pat Cummings, ""Ron Rothstein, his Heat coach, on the passing of Pat Cummings, “It’s a terribly sad thing to hear. Pat was a good guy. He gave us his all, he gave us whatever he had. He was a good guy. He was good with the younger players. He filled his role to the best of his capacity those first two years. We were lucky to have him."" 

58) Kurt Rambis, great player, better moustache, 4x NBA champion, honourable mention as Asst. Coach of Lakers (2016-18)

57) Manu Ginobili, 4x NBA champion, Spurs' legend, over a 23-season career, he was one of only two players to have win a EuroLeague title, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal. True legend.

56) Mickey Johnson/ Amir Johnson

55) Patty Mills, NBA champion and honorary former member of the Xinjiang Flying Tigers.

54) Sam Mitchell, known more for his Coach of the Year Award with Toronto and as an analyst for ESPN/ NBA TV. 4th in points, steals and assists in Timberwolves history. 

53) Anthony Mason, teammate of the great Patrick Ewing, Mason was an absolute brick shithouse.

52) Fred Hoiberg, not even gonna pretend I know much about him, this slot isn't exactly packed with mega stars. (Sorry to whoever takes offense)

51) Kyle Korver, 2009/10 season with Utah, Korver shot 53.6 percent from three-point range, which set an NBA single-season three-point field goal accuracy record. A true great in terms of shooting.

50) Steve Kerr, 5x champion as a player, 3x as coach, Kerr was prolific shooter and his three-point record stood uncontested until being broken by the aforementioned, Kyle Korver

49) ""Fast Eddie"" Johnson, 10 seasons in the league, remembered most by his time as a Hawk was both an offensive and defensive asset. However in 2008, ""Johnson was convicted of sexual battery of a minor under 12, lewd and lascivious molestation of a child under 12, and trespassing. The sex crimes carried a mandatory life sentence without parole. Johnson is currently incarcerated at Santa Rosa Correctional Institution"", so aside from his on court abilities, he's basically a monumental piece of shit as a human.

48) Marc Gasol, aka the 2019 champion, Marc Gasol, imo with his international career factored in, a strong HOF candidate.

47) Paul Millsap, the goat, jk, but 4x NBA All-Star selections is nothing to sneeze at.

46) Jeff ""Horny"" Hornacek, jersey number 14 retired by Utah Jazz, a dynamic player with (1077 GP) he's also been a well received coach in the league, most notably for the Phoenix Suns.

45) Bob Dandridge/ Antonio Davis

44) Malik Rose, NBA champion x2

43) Michael Redd, NBA record for most three-point field goals made in one quarter with 8 in the fourth quarter (February 20, 2002 vs. Houston Rockets); since broken by Klay Thompson on January 23, 2015.

42) Zaza Pachulia, 2x NBA champion, recorded 22 points and 21 rebounds in a 129–127 overtime loss to the Brooklyn Nets. His 21 rebounds included 18 offensive rebounds, which marked an NBA season high and a Bucks franchise record.

41) Nikola Jokić. Perhaps an honourable mention to Cuttino Mobley, not a goat by any means, but he was a big impact during his 10 years in the league, stemming from being drafted to the Houston Rockets and ending his career as a Los Angeles Clipper.

40) George Gervin, because who else


39) Anthony Johnson, not to be confused with the MMA fighter, Anthony Joshson, first D league player to make the Finals. (Conflicted opinion/placement)
Honourable mention to AL Attles.

38) Mehmet Okur, the only person to be associated with ""okur"" that I'm fine with (Sorry cardi b fans) (Not actually sorry cardi b fans)

37) Archie Clark, safe name to put in this slot because his crossover dribbling helped coin the phrase ""shake and bake"" (shout out to Ricky Bobby)
He was part of the trade that brought Wilt t the Lakers and was also a cofounder of the National Basketball Retired Players Association in '92, so props for that are in order.

36) Maurice Cheeks, name got me thinking of Kyle Lowry with the GOAT booty, but I digress.

35) DeAndre Jordan/ Draymond Green/ Carlos Boozer, this one is subjective, I'll let you all be the judge, jury and executioner.

34) Norm Van Lier, way before my time, but 'Stormin' Norman' was a big player in the 70's heat. C.J Miles is respectable company to this slot.

33) Happy Hairston, because what a fucking name if we're being honest

32) Rashad Lewis, 2013 championship with Miami Heat. Also a fellow SuperSonic alumnus.

31) Doc Rivers, 2nd round 31st pick, made this spot for his playing/coaching.

30) Spencer Haywood, only HOF member at the 30th slot, NBA champion, 4x All-star, his number 24 was retired as a Supersonic; shootout to the the Supersonics ✊.
Honourable mentions to David Lee and Jimmy Butlet.

29) Dennis Johnson (2nd round), hopefully I don't get butchered for honesty but I know very little about this man, never watched him play (before my time) but he was considered criminally underappreciated in the draft and even more so during his tenure in the league. 

28) Tony Parker, 6x All-star, 4x champion and his zodiac sign is Taurus.

27) Dennis Rodman, the guy was rebounding the ball while tapping Madonna. Shout out to the fellas: Kyle Kuzma, Pascal Siakam, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Rudy Gobert, respectively selected at 27th.

26) Vlade Divac, who I'll call, ""the Serbian fridge"" takes this spot, wasn't the most polarizing player but the guy was big enough to have his own area code
Charlie Ward, Jerome Williams, Gerald Wallace, and Jordan Farmar as honorable mentions.

25) Mark Price, hailed as ""Cleveland's best sports trade ever"" and don't fucking at me cause it was a fan vote that I wasn't a part of 

24) Arvydas Sabonis, this one is tough because he's one of the greater European players thats played in the league, but he spares the same slot selection as Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Sam Cassell, Terry Porter and Latrell Sprewell, so this one is a judgement call depending on the person.

23) Alex English, arguably best Denver player of all time, 21.5ppg 

22) Reggie Lewis, dude this one is hard to even type, after 6 seasons he dropped dead on the court, put him here out of respect.

21) Rajon Rando, ok this guy was a fucking gift at 21st pick, 4x defensive all team, 3x APG league leader, also ranks 11th in triple doubles and if you're gonna call him a stat padder then I mean, you wouldn't be the only one. Honourable mention to Michael Finley, NBA champion, 2x All-star, became only the third rookie in Suns history to score over 1,000 points in a season.

20) Larry Nance, guy was a unit. First slam dunk contest winner ever.

19) Nate Archibald, 1970 - Archibald is still the only player in NBA history to lead the league in both scoring and assists in a single season and that's pretty neat

18) Joe Dumars, 1989 Finals MVP and a 4x All-Defensive First Team selections and arguably one of the best defenders in league history.

17) Shawn Kemp- although Don Nelson (17th pick in '62) won five NBA championships so he could be interchanged depending on who's asking.

16) John Stockton, this one is not even close, 19 seasons with the Jazz, 19 playoff appearances, 14.5 APG in 1989/1990, a record in NBA history.

15) Steve Nash, the man could shoot a cannon through a crowded Walmart and hit his intended target in the women's clothing department. This one is tough because one look at Nash's whole career and you'll understand the placement, but imo Kawhi could pass him by the end of his career. (Arguably the most controversial, in terms of feedback on last post)

14) Clyde ""The Glyde"" Drexler, NBA champion, 10x All-star, 5x All NBA Team.

13) Kobe Bryant, the name we all call when shooting a piece of paper into a garbage bin, respectively joined by Karl Malone

12) Julius Erving, cooler than a tranquilized cucumber

11) Reggie Miller, an absolutely amazing shooter, which is fitting because he shares the same draft selection as Klay Thompson. Klay is a strong candidate to pass Reggie one day, but if you watched Reggie play, you'll respect the decision.

10) Paul Pierce, one of the most clutch ̶s̶h̶i̶t̶t̶e̶r̶s shooters ever perhaps.

9) Dirk Nowitzki, his name is harder to pronounce than most foreign countries but the man is an absolute beast and there's not a damn thing you can say to change my mind.

8) ̶J̶a̶m̶a̶l̶ ̶C̶r̶a̶w̶f̶o̶r̶d̶,̶ ̶N̶B̶A̶ ̶6̶t̶h̶ ̶m̶a̶n̶ ̶x̶3̶,̶ ̶c̶u̶r̶r̶e̶n̶t̶l̶y̶ ̶h̶o̶l̶d̶s̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶N̶B̶A̶ ̶c̶a̶r̶e̶e̶r̶ ̶r̶e̶c̶o̶r̶d̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶m̶o̶s̶t̶ ̶c̶a̶r̶e̶e̶r̶ ̶f̶o̶u̶r̶-̶p̶o̶i̶n̶t̶ ̶p̶l̶a̶y̶s̶ ̶m̶a̶d̶e̶ ̶w̶i̶t̶h̶ ̶5̶5̶ ̶(̶6̶0̶ ̶w̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶c̶o̶u̶n̶t̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶p̶l̶a̶y̶o̶f̶f̶s̶)̶.̶ ̶I̶ ̶a̶l̶s̶o̶ ̶d̶o̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶a̶ ̶c̶l̶u̶e̶ ̶w̶h̶o̶ ̶a̶n̶y̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶o̶t̶h̶e̶r̶ ̶p̶l̶a̶y̶e̶r̶s̶ ̶a̶r̶e̶ ̶s̶o̶ ̶l̶e̶t̶'̶s̶ ̶g̶r̶a̶z̶e̶ ̶o̶v̶e̶r̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶o̶n̶e̶.̶ Robert Parish, obviously.

7) Steph Curry, recent studies have shown that Steph is really good at shooting a basketball into the net, some call him an absolute warrior (sorry) 
Honourable mention to John Havlicek.

6) Larry Bird, the man, the myth, the legend

5) This one is tough, KG is an absolute unit, but Pippen, Charles Barkley and Dwayne Wade are all greats. *Paul Pierce has entered the chat* ""I would like everyone to know that I had a better career than all of them."" Ty Paul, moving on.

4) Chris Paul, 4x assist leader, 6x steals leader, great hairline. Chris Bosh &amp; Russell Westbrook as two honourable mentions.

3) MJ: he's like, kinda good at basketball 🐐

2) Bill Russell: 2nd overall pick, more rings than a pawn shop, KD honourable mention in every way.

1) LeBron James/ Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Incredible honourable mentions to Hakeem Olajuwon, Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'neal and our boy, Tim Duncan. Each of these players are among the greatest of all time, but not naming LeBron seems sacrilegious.

traded our capital(again) for Harden 

Let Kyrie come back part time.. so what is it that we didn’t understand? That he didn’t want to be vaccinated?? We brought this man back and funny enough, that’s reportedly when him and Harden started to fall out more.  

We let him take a leave previously without telling anyone. Nash didn’t even know what was going on 

And this isn’t even getting into the rumors of buying penthouses and planes or whatever.

At this point I’m ready to restart. Give me some young guys with something to prove. I’m bout done with Kyrie and if KD is this emotionally attached to that man *that* much, then we better be prepared to deal him starting next week.


Marks is a great GM, but that’s been forgotten in us letting these 2 run the franchise and dragging  Steve Nash out of whatever he was doing with soccer to coach cause he and KD had a relationship when he was in golden state. 



[I said it in the nets sub before ](https://np.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/srace4/can_we_all_just_be_honest_kyrie_be_talking/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) but this man just spewing so much non sense and KD backing it up smh

You from Jersey and grew up a nets fan. Nobody should understand how important this championship window was than Kyrie. 

Didn’t work in cleveland? Well most people understood you wanting to get away from Bron

Didn’t work with Boston??  Well you were a prick most of that time and threw that bucks series but whatever. You had personal reasons for going back on your word to return to Boston even if you acted like a clown throughout your Boston time. 

But again, this was the first time you got to choose a team that you grew up loving. Got your best friend here. A legit shot to win without Lebron and you pretty much ruined it. 


And speaking of Lebron, you know what? Kyrie can head on out to LA. Better yet, I hope he takes the MLE too so they can keep Westbrook in the process and both of them can drive Bron further into retirement. That would be my satisfaction in all of this. 

Sorry for the stray….lakers fans, I’m just saying.",6179,1225,2022-06-26,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vku8rm/netsdaily_on_mismatch_podcast_kevin_oconnor_talks/
nba,"Dec 21st, 2014: The 5-23 Detroit Pistons fall 105-110 to Brooklyn, after Josh Smith underperformed again, with 13pts on 5-16 FG w/ 2TOs and 5PFs, Detroit decided they'd rather pay him to play elsewhere. The Pistons cut Smith, and went on a magical 12-3 run over the next month before tragedy struck.","This is random lore in NBA history, and I'm bored, I miss writing papers for school sometimes so I felt like writing this up. I'm sure some people won't care, but those who do will read it because I remember just how wild it all was in the moment.

# What Sparked The Run

# 

[**December 21st, 2014, following a 2-17 run over the last 19, the Pistons play the Brooklyn Nets and lose 105-110**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPpP9BE6Dqg&amp;ab_channel=BridgetMaggard)

* In the 3 years before leaving Atlanta, **Josh Smith averaged 18/9/4 on 46/30/63 splits**. Joe Dumars, the GM of Detroit at the time, had signed him in hopes that they finally have a go-to guy to get buckets when they need them, however that wasn't what Pistons fans got, instead they got 1 final ""fuck you"" from Joe Dumars after blowing up the Goin-To-Work Pistons making bad decision after bad decision. In his first year, he put up 16/7/3 but his efficiency from Atlanta went down the drain, and what little 3 pt shot he had, seemed to disappear, shooting 41/26/53 on 16 attempts a game, adding on to 2.6 turnovers per game.
* The first half of the following year was even worse, averaging 13 points on 14 attempts a game(39/24/46 splits), to go along with almost 3 turnovers per game across the first 28 games of the season. Something was wrong with this guy. And this game was the straw that broke the camels back for Detroit's 1st year GM Jeff Bower where he realized, this guy ain't it. This wasn't the guy Detroit originally had hoped for. **Josh Smith threw up 16 shots, and only hit 5 of them. Tallying only 13 points**, *he did* have 5 rebounds, 6 assists and 6 stocks, only to go along with 2 turnovers, 5 fouls, all 5 of them coming in the 2nd half, where he went 2/9. Seriously, Pistons fans were starting to hate this guy, he played as if he was Carmelo Anthony but performed as if he was Kendrick Perkins.
* Detroit realized that that Josh Smith was *not the guy* who was going to pull Detroit out of the lottery and to the playoffs. He was taking shots away from the young guys like Andre Drummond(21Y/O), Brandon Jennings(25) and KCP(21), and wasn't delivering on them.
* The next morning on December 22nd 2014, Jeff Bower gave the Pistons fans an early Christmas present and sent him packing.

* Brandon Jennings and KCP combined for 29 points on 48%, Jennings had 10 assists with only 1 turnover and KCP had 2 steals to go along with his usual defense.
* Andre Drummond put up 20 points with 6 rebounds on 75% starting next to
* In his first game without Josh Smith , **Greg Monroe put up 19 points, 15 rebounds, with 4 stocks** on 64% from the field.
* Pistons fans we're hype, considering they just dropped the bricklayer Smith, and won the game immediately after. Detroit fans were wondering if this could be something to get used to.

&amp;#x200B;

[**December 28th, 2014, after beating Indiana at home, Detroit had a challenge that was nothing like the Pacers, they went to Ohio to play the 18-12 Cleveland Cavaliers who were missing Kyrie, despite leading by as many as 15 points during the 2nd quarter, Detroit's post-J Smoove magic had them coming back and holding the lead going into the half.

* Seriously, just look at some of the 3s Brandon Jennings and KCP were hitting in those highlights, in transition **""I'm better than you""** 3s. Jennings was hooping this night. Put up 25 points, 5/9 from 3 to go with 5 boards and 6 assists.
* Andre Drummond had 16 points and 17 rebounds to go with **5 blocks!** including one on [Lebron James to get the game started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4mNQGsnqRg&amp;ab_channel=BridgetMaggard)

* Jodie Meeks *absolutely caught fire off the bench* going 6/6 from 3 in the *first half*. He would finish with **34 points on 11/16 from the field, 9/11 from 3**.
* Andre Drummond would have another great performance, putting up 17 PTs, 22 REBs and 5 Stocks, despite going 5-16 from the charity stripe lol.
* DJ Augustin, backup point guard, had 10 assists off the bench.
* Detroit's bench outscored Orlandos bench 55-31. The entire team was starting to look different from top to bottom. People were wondering if Josh Smith was really holding them back *this much*

**January 14th, 2015, Anthony Davis and Tyreke Evans were too much for Detroit and Detroit would lose 105-94. This was their first definitive loss in over 20 days.**

(couldn't find highlights for this one.)

* This was the first game the Pistons looked mortal and not only did they look mortal, they looked **awful**, shooting 46% from the field and 36% from 3 on 22 attempts.
* This was also the first game the entire stretch Detroit was out rebounded. The Twin Towers approach didn't work with Anthony Davis at the 4, as he turned Greg Monroe into BBQ chicken. Scoring 27 points on 18 shots. **AD and Omer Asik outrebounded Detroit's twin towers 23-10**. Detroit only had THREE offensive rebounds, where throughout this stretch of games that was one of the main reasons they were winning.
* As sad as it sounds, **this game was kind of the epitome of Andre Drummond in Detroit**, he was almost guaranteed a couple times a month to put up a game like this, where he was extremely lackadaisical, and seemed not to care. SVG eventually benched him 5 minutes into the 3rd quarter after being a -20 and only grabbing 2 rebounds.
* **SVG had this to say about Drummond**:  *""This is four games in a row where he hasn't had any energy,"" Van Gundy said. ""Tonight, he didn't even rebound. That's why I didn't bring him back in the second half. He wasn't bringing us anything tonight.""*

I wonder to this day what could have happened with this squad had Jennings not been injured or stayed in the game in that blowout. I was always a Pistons fan, but after years of purgatory, Josh Smith literally made me start to hate watching Detroit. It was hard to tune in every night, I'd mostly just check the box score, and see if the highlights were worth watching. But after waiving Josh Smith I decided to watch that first game vs the Pacers and what I saw was a completely different team largely in thanks to Brandon Jennings, he is always gonna be one of my favorite players because of this stretch and I'll always defend his name in hoop conversations for this alone.  Ever since that run I can't look away from Detroit no matter how bad we've been however the future is *finally* looking bright.

I know this is an incredibly long post, and I'm not the best writer, but I wanted to help capture some of the magic that Pistons fans were feeling for the first time in a LONG time during this stretch.",6060,225,2022-11-22,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/z1prt5/dec_21st_2014_the_523_detroit_pistons_fall_105110/

nba,[OC] Will Brook Lopez make the Hall of Fame — in an alternate future where we give full credit to zygotic splitting?,"In the womb, a zygote will sometimes split into two, a process that leads to identical twins. And yet, despite that selfless and generous act, the zygote has not enjoyed full credit for the stats that their other half produces.

What if that changed? What if we gave justice to those noble zygotes? What if we merged the careers of Brook and Robin Lopez into one?

We finally answers those what ifs, as we examine the alternate history of the legendary **[RO-BRO LOPEZ](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/sports/basketball/brook-and-robin-lopez-with-identical-genes-are-often-a-study-in-contrasts.html)** .

*editor's note: we're just crudely combining their per-game averages here, although that's not the most accurate given that they played different amount of games per year. In fact, technically speaking, these sums should be split in half for proper ""per game"" numbers. Still, if you're looking for factual accuracy, this post may not be for you.*

---

######**the illustrious career of RO-BRO LOPEZ**

**2008-09**: 16.2 points, 10.1 rebounds, 1.1 assists, 2.5 blocks

*As a rookie, Robin Lopez didn't contribute much at all (3 points a game), leaving the Brook side of this conjoined twin act to carry the weight. Fortunately, he's up to the task. Thanks to the extra brotherly boost, Ro-Bro Lopez manages to win ROOKIE OF THE YEAR in a narrow vote over Derrick Rose, who averaged 17-6 for the Bulls.*

**2009-10**: 27.2 points, 13.5 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 2.4 blocks

*Ro-Bro takes a massive step up as a sophomore (fueled largely by Brook's 19-8 in real life). Not only does he snag an ALL-STAR bid, but he becomes a very serious MVP candidate as well. However, the media is still in love with LeBron James and gives the King a repeat MVP after his 30-7-9 campaign (in his last season in Cleveland.) Clearly, LeBron must have sensed the rising threat of Ro-Bro, because he fled to Miami right after this season.*

**2010-11**: 26.8 points, 9.2 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 2.2 blocks

*After many Ro-Bro fans feel like he got snubbed for MVP in the prior season, the outraged boils over when he gets snubbed AGAIN. Bulls star Derrick Rose's impact and narrative outweighed his counting stats (25-8) and helped fuel his campaign. Meanwhile, Ro-Bro split some votes with the other top center Dwight Howard, whose stats are similar (23-14 with 2.4 blocks.) In fact, Ro-Bro's win total of 64 (24 for Brook, 40 for Robin) didn't separate him much either, as Rose's Bulls won 62.*

**2011-12**: 24.6 points, 9.2 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 2.2 blocks

*The Ro-Bro Mania takes a step back after his Brook foot breaks, making Robin carry much of the weight for this season. (Although I suppose Ro-Bro may be a centaur with 4 legs?) Either way, Ro-Bro has a lost season and even misses out on All-Star status for the first time since his rookie year.*

**2012-13**: 30.7 points, 12.5 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 3.7 blocks

*After a down year, Ro-Bro Lopez bounces back in a major way, helped largely by the fact that Robin Lopez would become a starter (for the next 6 seasons.) An ALL-STAR is a certainty, but the MVP comes down to Ro-Bro against an old rival: LeBron James (who won after averaging 27-8-7 for the Heat.) The media once again pushes for the King (coming off his first title in Miami), justified by a growing analytics movement that cited James' win share advantage (of 19.3, compared to a combined 10.9 for the brothers.) Ro-Bro fans are furious with the decision, and cite an unfair bias against multiples.*

**2013-14**: 31.8 points, 14.5 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 3.2 blocks

*Ro-Bro has arguably his best year ever on paper (earning another ALL-STAR), but ends up missing too many games to win MVP again. Brother Brook had another foot injury and only played 17 games. And while that would technically be 99 if you include Robin, we're halving the games and giving him only 45.*

**2014-15**: 27.5 points, 14.2 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 3.2 blocks

*Now at full strength, Ro-Bro puts up another Joel Embiid - like figures, nabs an ALL-STAR, and even wins his first MVP! The actual winner Steph Curry had a great narrative as the Warriors broke out with 67 wins, but Curry's raw numbers (24 points, 8 assists a game) can't match up with the consistent statistical dominance of our embryo.*

**2015-16**: 30.2 points, 15.2 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 3.3 blocks

*Steph Curry gets his revenge. Curry stepped up his play, scoring 30 points a game and leading the Warriors to a record 73 wins. While Ro-Bro's stats may stack up with him, his ""winning"" leaves something to be desired. Brook's Nets and Robin's Knicks combined for a paltry 53 wins (21 and 32, respectively.) An ALL-STAR but not MVP here.*

**2016-17**: 30.5 points, 11.8 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 3.1 blocks

*Another 30-10 season earns Ro-Bro an ALL-STAR and a top 3 MVP finish, but not the trophy itself. Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook bested him in points (31.6 per game) and almost matched him in rebounds (10.7). In fact, there's some growing criticism about Ro-Bro's rebounding numbers. Sure, 11.8 per game sounds great, but it may be a little underwhelming for a 14-footer.*

**2017-18**: 24.9 points, 8.5 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 2.2 blocks

*As Brook Lopez started to drift more and more to the perimeter, we see Ro-Bro's game evolve in the same way. Unfortunately, Ro-Bro misses the All-Star game for the first time in ages. Part of that is a statistical dip, but part of that is due to the fact that he's split between two losing teams, with the Luke Walton Lakers (Brook) and Fred Hoiberg Bulls (Robin) respectively.*

**2018-19**: 22.1 points, 8.8 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 3.3 blocks

*While Ro-Bro's stats continue to dip, he's rewarded by the media with a one last ALL-STAR trip. He's given a lot of credit for his evolving perimeter game (up to a career-high 2.4 threes per game, 2.3 by Brook) and the fact that's contributing to the ascent of the first-place Milwaukee Bucks.*

**2019-20**: 17.5 points, 7.1 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 3.1 blocks

*At this stage in his career, Ro-Bro will have to focus on defensive awards. He wins another All-Defense team (which Brook did on his own) but isn't in play for All-Stars or MVPs anymore. And at this stage, Ro-Bro doesn't care. He's chasing the one thing that's alluded him in his illustrious career: a title ring.*

**2020-21**: 21.3 points, 8.8 rebounds, 1.5 assists, 2.1 blocks

*Another strong season by Ro-Bro, albeit without any awards. However, he's still in contention to win his first ever championship. In fact, Ro-Bro's chase for his first ring is as big of a story as Chris Paul's.*

**OVERALL**: 25.3 points, 11.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 2.9 blocks

*As we look back at Ro-Bro Lopez's great career so far, we have to acknowledge him as one of the best centers of all-time. Among his accolades: 1 Rookie of the Year, 8 All-Star appearances, and 1 MVP trophy (along with a bunch of defensive trophies.) His closest comparison may be David Robinson, who won an MVP and averaged 21.1 points, 10.6 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks over the course of his career. Unfortunately for Ro-Bro Lopez, he is still lacking a ring that other great centers have enjoyed as the topper for their career. But make no mistake about it, that career ends with Ro-Bro earning his place in the HALL of FAME. Congrats, Ro-Bro!*",5514,272,2021-07-10,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ohhzb1/oc_will_brook_lopez_make_the_hall_of_fame_in_an/
nba,[OC] Every NBA Team Ranked By How Well They Have Performed To Preseason Expectations This Regular Season.,"  
With the regular season now done and dusted I decided it would be cool to take a look back at every NBA team this season and place them into tiers on the level that they have performed at this season. Of course every situation is different and so I have factored in the teams overall win-loss record but also how they have responded to difficult situations this season such as injuries or the context of how they have performed.  
  
**This is just my opinion and I am keen to shuffle the list around if people disagree with my results so feel free to leave your input and I will be very willing to take it into consideration. Please don’t be too harsh and I will try to make sure my rankings are as accurate as possible**  
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
Just a couple other things to consider:  
—When I state my predicted expectations It as an average of preseason rankings from ESPN, 
Bleacher Report, Sports Illustrated, CBS Sports and USA Today. 
-This is the [link] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/76r1af/201718_season_predictions_from_the_rnba_power/) to the NBA preseason power ranking predictions that I make reference to in my post.  
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
**EDIT:** After reading all your awesome comments I’ve reconsidered and decided to move some teams around.  
  
I have moved San Antonio into their own category after coming to the realisation that they were in a somewhat similar situation to Boston who I highly rated. However they were far and away the most difficult team to rate because all the signs point to them having underperformed but obviously Leonard was out for so long so I don't know how they would've performed.. 
  
I have moved the Clippers down into the slightly didn’t meet expectations section after understanding more that the Blake trade was a direct result of them not being quite in the playoff race.  
  
I have moved Toronto into the completely exceeded expectations section as the second best record in the league is nothing to scoff at especially when the team is barely tipped to win 50 games.  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
  
**Completely Exceeded Expectations**  
  
**—Indiana Pacers** W/L Record: 48-34  
The Indiana Pacers were predicted to win 32 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 30 games. They were viewed as a team that would be stuck in a difficult rebuild position after the departure of Paul George but have performed outstandingly. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 2/30 voters expected Indiana to make the playoffs and both of those were as the 8th seed. Indiana winning close to 50 games was just ridiculous to even consider and something not even the biggest Pacers fans would’ve thought possible.  

If they were to have any success this season most people thought it would come from the development of young centre Myles Turner who would carry the load for Indiana and have a break through season but it was former Thunder player Victor Oladipo that has come to the rescue. In his first season in Indiana Oladipo has improved his scoring this season from 15.9 points per game to an incredible 23.1while also posting career high numbers in rebounds, assists, steals, blocks and shooting the best splits of his 5 season career. Victors ability to turn the Pacers into a not just a borderline but great playoff team this season should not go unrecognised and he is likely to be awarded the NBA award for Most Improved Player by seasons end. 

**—Philadelphia 76ers** W/L Record: 52-30   
The Philadelphia 76ers were predicted to win 39 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as few as 33 games. The common thought process around the 76ers was that they were an exciting young team whose lack of experience may prevent them from making playoffs but they could make a lot of noise in a year or two. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 12/30 voters expected Philadelphia to make the playoffs with more than half of those tipping and 8th seed. This enough would’ve been considered a great achievement for the 76ers but instead they have improved tremendously and will own home court advantage in the first round of playoffs.  
  
Perhaps the most obvious reason for Philadelphias surge this year has been the emergence of rookie superstar Ben Simmons who has averaged 16/8/8 through the season and has played brilliant defence. His playmaking ability is already elite and despite the lack of an effective jump shot he is still able to score 16 points per game on efficient shooting. The generational talent is playing at a level we have rarely seen in the NBA from anyone but to be doing it at such a young age is frightening for the rest of the league. I might be a Utah fan but in the end I think that what Ben Simmons has achieved in his first year of actual play has been special which is why I think he is the 2017-18 Rookie of the year.  
  
**—Utah Jazz**  W/L Record: 48-34       
The Utah Jazz were predicted to win 42 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as few as 36 games. In a somewhat similar situation to Indiana many expected a decline from the Jazz when Gordon Hayward left in free agency. The common belief existed that Utah were not a playoff caliber team and that their lack of offensive fire power would leave them exposed and their defence would not be able to compensate for that. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions only 3/30 voters expected Utah to finish higher than the 8th seed. In the end improvements from Ingles and Rubio, a bounce back year for Favors and the unexpected emergence Donovan Mitchell has helped lead the Jazz to the 5th seed in a super competitive Western Conference.   
  
However when speaking of impact and the Utah Jazz it is simply impossible not to mention defensive anchor Rudy Gobert. Their is a direct correlation to Utahs success and Rudy Gobert playing this season. None more so then when Gobert went down with a second knee injury in late November which lead to him missing close to 30 games before finally returning. However since his return the Jazz have a record of 30-8 and the best defence in the league. Despite the amount of games he has missed this year I think Gobert is deserving of this seasons Defensive player of the year award for his impact on the Jazz and how great of magnitude a difference he has made when he is on the court.  
  
**—Boston Celtics** W/L Record: 55-27     
The Boston Celtics were predicted to win 54 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as few as 49 games. Some people thought that was a little generous given the enormous roster turnaround that saw just 4 Celtics remain from the team that made the ECF just a year prior, while others considered this squad a direct upgrade over last seasons team. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions Boston were considered almost a consensus top 2 team in the East with 28/30 rankers voting accordingly. The Celtics season began in shocking fashion when they suffered a devastating blow as newly acquired all-star Gordon Hayward went down with a season ending injury. This lead many to questioning what Boston could actually achieve this season. Some wondering whether the squad could even make the playoffs.  
  
It hasn’t been an issue for them and they have marched to the second seed in the East despite other key injuries to forward Marcus Morris and defensive guard Marcus Smart missing close to a 3rd of the year. Kyrie Irving demonstrated to the league that he has what what it takes to lead a great team after leaving Lebron and the Cavs in the offseason and being able to take the 2nd seed in the East. As is the theme with these Celtics Irving has missed 20 games through injury and will be out for their playoff push. None the less what the Celtics have been able to achieve this season is nothing short of incredible and In my opinion Brad Stevens deserves recognition for his role in their success and should win Coach Of The Year.  
  
**—Toronto Raptors** W/L Record: 59-23  
The Toronto Raptors were predicted to win 47 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as few as 43 games. After a disappointing exist from the playoffs last season after being swept people still considered the Raptors to be a good team but didn’t quite think they would be competing for a championship. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30 voters expected playoffs but just 1 voter expected a top two seed which the Raptors were ultimately able to achieve rather clinically. A complete culture reset placing a greater emphasis on three point shooting and general ball movement has been a big part of their success and that is without even making reference to their incredible bench. They were expected to make the playoffs but a near 60 win season is something that not even die hard Raptors fans could’ve seen coming. While I am predicting Brad Stevens to win Coach of they year I definitely think Casey should be runner up.  
    
———————————————————————————————————————————  
     
**Exceeded Expectations**  
  
**—Houston Rockets** W/L Record: 65-17     
The Houston Rockets were predicted to win 57 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as few as 55 games. Unlike most other situations were teams have exceeded expectations the Rockets still had very high hopes bested upon them after finishing second in the Western conference. There were concerns that the backcourt duo of Harden and Paul would struggle chemistry wise but that hasn’t been a problem at all. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30 voters predicted a top four seed for the Rockets with 18/30 voters expected Houston to finish second, but with no votes for first. A combination of outstanding performance and Golden State injuries has lead to them finishing as the far and away the number one team in the league and dare I say championship favourite?  
  
An underrated aspect of their excellence this season has been the defensive improvement of the Rockets powered by Ariza, Capella, Mbah A Moute and Tucker. Really though we can all pin point where the majority of the Rockets success has come from and that is the MVP level play of James Harden. The Beard is this seasons favourite for the MVP having averaged 31/5/9 but Houston and leading his team to the best record. Houston are every chance right now to go all the way and take home their 3rd championship in franchise history and I am intrigued to see if they can carry there form into the playoffs. 
  
**—Portland Trailblazers** W/L Record: 49-33  
The Portland Trailblazers were predicted to win 41 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 37 games. Heading into the season they were expected to take home a low playoff spot as they hadn’t changed too much in the offseason but were still a reliably good team. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 21/30 voters anticipated a playoff berth but none saw the Blazers as a top 4 seed. Despite a poorer end to the season then they would’ve liked the Blazers were able to out perform their expectations lead by the amazing performance of Damian Lillard while CJ McCollum has still been effective in a bit of a down year. Perhaps what has been most impressive for the Blazers is the transformation for Portland on the defensive side of the court as they have finished top 10 in defence, A distinct characteristic that separates this squad from other Portland teams of the past.   
    
**—New Orleans Pelicans** W/L Record: 48-34  
The New Orleans Pelicans were predicted to win 41 games in the preseason with Sports Illustrated predicting them to win as few as 39 games. To be perfectly honest while New Orleans were recognised for their talent having two players that are arguably top 10 they were considered to in the preseason to be a team that would fail to succeed which is why expectations were so low. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 2/30 voters though they would finish sixth or higher. Throw in the fact that DeMarcus Cousins has missed 35 games and I think you have to say the Pelicans season exceed expectations. Huge credit is due to Anthony Davis who is having an insane season offensively and defensively is currently looking to win the first playoff series of his young career. The Pelicans are definitely a team to look out for next season with a healthy Cousins, rejuvenated Holiday and Mirotic continuing to play an effective role in the team.
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
**Slightly Exceeded Expectations**  

**—Brooklyn Nets**  W/L Record: 28-54  
The Brooklyn Nets were predicted to win 28 games in the preseason with CBS Sports predicting them to win as few as 21 games. Even thought the preseason projections were pretty accurate Id say that the Nets were able to exceeded expectations with the way they were able to remain competitive against strong teams and were able to play overcoming an early season injury to Jeremy Lin and D’Angelo Russell missing large parts of the season as well. Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris and Rondae Hollis Jefferson all made big improvements this season for the Nets and capped of a satisfactory season for Brooklyn. Rookie Jarret Allen looks like an exciting prospect and was one of the bright spots on the year. I’m still not too sure what the future holds for the Nets but as a starting point they finally own their own draft pick next season. Additionally I feel that this season has helped Brooklyn at least identify more players part of their long term plans.  
  
**—Chicago Bulls** W/L Record: 27-55  
The Chicago Bulls were predicted to win 25 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 20 games. After a shocking start where the Bulls were just 3-20 they had a mini revival as Mirotic returned from injury but he was moved in a trade to New Orleans later on. Lauri Markannen had an exciting rookie season, Kris Dunn improved tremendously and Zach LaVine played well after returning from his ACL injury. The Bulls fans might have preferred the team win less games to ensure a higher draft pick but I think this year will be considered a good result after departing from Jimmy Butler and starting their first season in the rebuild.  
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
**Met Expectations**  
  
**—Minnesota Timberwolves** W/L Record: 47-35  
The Minnesota Timberwolves were predicted to win 48 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 50 games. The expectations coming into the season was that Minnesota were a young team who with an added allstar in Jimmy Butler would compete for a top 4 seed in the conference. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 25/30 voters expected the Wolves to make the playoffs with 11 of those expecting them to be in the 5th position. The drought is now finally over and Minnesota are back in the playoffs after ending a 15 year streak without postseason action. It was a nervy finish but they got there. They were expected to finish a little higher but to finally just make the 8, I don’t think any Wolves fans will worry. This squad was the 3rd seed in the West when healthy and will be looking to shake things up.  
  
**—New York Knicks** W/L Record: 29-53 
The New York Knicks were predicted to win 30 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 35 games. The year didn’t start off too poorly and looked to be a dark horse competitor for a low playoff seed being lead by the terrific play of younger superstar Kristaps Porzingis. Porzingis had thrived in a role as the number one option following the Carmelo Anthony before an ACL injury derailed his campaign. Trey Burke has had a resurgence much like Michael Beasley, Tim Hardaway has been solid and Kanter has had a career best season. There is good reason for optimism for the Knicks going forward but they still need just one more young piece.  

**—Miami Heat** W/L Record: 44-38   
The Miami Heat were predicted to win 43 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 44 games. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions they were tipped to finish as either the 6th or 7th seed in the East. There isn’t really too much more to add for the Heat as they have performed exactly the way many thought they would. Goran Dragic making his first all star appearance was a highlight of the season for the Heat and Wayne Ellington has been a big improver.   
  
**—LA Lakers** W/L Record: 35-47   
The La Lakers were predicted to win 32 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 35 games. Things didn’t really start off very well follow for Los Angeles but after a poor first half of the season the Lakers played above 0.500 basketball for the 2nd half. It was a stretch that included some wins against good teams and showed their fans a slight glimpse into what the future holds. I think its fair to say Lonzo didn’t quite live up to expectations but Ingram’s improvement was exciting for the Lakers and they found and absolute steal in Kyle Kuzma while Josh hart was nothing short of impressive either for a 30th pick. The future is promising and who knows, If they can attract a big name free agent this summer they could find themselves well in the mix for playoff next season. 
  
**—Sacramento Kings** W/L Record: 26-56      
The Sacramento Kings were predicted to win 31 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 27 games. Bogdan Bogdanovic had a successful rookie season and Fox has produced some breathtaking highlights specifically in the clutch. In their first full season without DeMarcus Cousins in quite some time, despite not meeting the win expectations, I think the Kings have made up for that on the back of the performance of their young players this season which have provided them with some excitement in the future.  
  

**—Atlanta Hawks** W/L Record: 24-58   
The Atlanta Hawk were predicted to win 27 games in the preseason with USA Today expecting them to win as many as 32 games. While they weren’t really set with high expectations I still feel that Atlanta has been ok in their circumstances. Additionally they aren’t exactly just an easy beat that their record would have you suggest as the performed very well against the Western conference and some of there elite teams. Dennis Shroeder didn’t quite have the break out season Atlanta fans were expecting but Taurean Prince was able to elevate his play and the Hawks have found themselves in a good position to net a high draft pick and set themselves up for the future as they continue to retool while remaining competitive.  
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
**Slightly Didn’t Meet Expectations**  
      
**—Washington Wizards** W/L Record: 43-39  
The Washington Wizards were predicted to win 48 games in the preseason with USA Today expecting them to win as many as 51 games. I expected the Wizards to be a top 3 seed and based of off their form in the back end of last season I thought they could legitimately challenge for the Easts top seed. It is understandable why they have struggled this season however with star point guard John Wall having missed about half the season. It will be interesting to see how they play this playoffs with a healthy team and whether they can steal a series victory from one of the leagues top seeds.  
  
**—Denver Nuggets** W/L Record: 46-36   
The Denver Nuggets were predicted to win 44 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 47 games. The expectations coming into the season was that Denver were a young team who with an added allstar in Paul Millsap would compete for a huge seed in the Western Conference but just a fall short of a top 4 spot. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 27/30 voters expected Denver to make the playoffs with 20 of those as a either a 5th or 6th seed. A late 6 game win streak wasn’t enough to for the Nuggets whose final night of the season loss saw them miss the playoffs. Jokic, Harris and Murray were seen as a big three that could matchup extremely well with the Warriors but in the end they won’t even qualify. Expect a big bounce back next season if they finally fire Malone and get an adequate coach.  
  
**—LA Clippers** W/L Record: 42-40    
The LA Clippers were predicted to win 45 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report predicting them to win as few as 43 games. Despite losing Chirs Paul in the offseason people still expected the Clippers to be competing for and making the playoffs. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 20/30 voters said that the Clippers would make the playoffs. It makes it interesting to judge because on the one hand the Clippers were very close to their expected win mark but they still didn’t make the playoffs in a super competitive West which would've been expected. Their season began fairly well for the Clippers but as time went on they began to suffer seriously in injuries with Beverly, Gallinari and Teodosic all missing significant time. Blake Griffins trade was a move that has actually set the Clippers up well for the future as well. Ultimately however while it is very close I think I have to say the Clippers didn't meet expectations simply on the fact that they didn’t make the playoffs which a majority of voters and experts predicted. The star of the show for the Clippers was definitely Lou Williams. The clear 6th man of the year played at an allstar level having a career best season. I think next season the Clippers are set to shake up the West when healthy.  
  
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
**Didn’t Meet Expectations**  
  
**—OKC Thunder** W/L Record: 48-34
The OKC Thunder were predicted to win 52 games in the preseason with USA Today expecting them to win as many as 59 games. The external expectation around this squad was that Carmelo Anthony and Paul George where big upgrades to a squad that won 47 games the year prior. Some people were even considering OKC as the second best team in the league following the Paul George trade. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions their lowest rank was at 4th in the West from 30 voters so they were very much expected to do well. However that hasn’t eventuated and the team has been really disappointing as a whole this season. It seems strange that adding a player with 10 consecutive allstar appearances and another with 5 career appearances only helped OKC win one extra game. Thunder fans are quick to point out Roberson’s injury but the reality is that a team with two prime top 15 players should not have been struggling so much to make playoffs. Perhaps they have been cruising though and I guess we will see this postseason. 

**—Detroit Pistons** W/L Record: 39-43  
The Detroit Pistons were predicted to win 39 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 43 games. Pre-season predictions often centred around the seeding of the final spots in the East with the Pistons one of the teams expected to compete. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 11/30 voters saw tipped them for make a playoff appearance but many others considering them a 9th seed at worst. Detroit looked to have shown the league that they were a playoff caliber when they started 9-3 but weren’t able to continue that form and ended up finishing as the 9th seed. A desperate trade for Blake Griffin in the back end of the season saw Harris and Bradley flipped in what appeared to be a panic decision and attempted quick fix but paired with Reggie Jacksons injury and other issues in play style they were unable to make a big playoff push. Andre Drummond took another step forward in his development after a down year last season and I think they could make the top 8 next season. I just don’t see a tremendous upside for this team in the long run. Oh, and after they took on Griffins lengthy contract, they could be stuck around the 7-10 range for a while.  
  
**—Orlando Magic** W/L Record: 25-57 
The Orlando Magic were predicted to win 31 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 34 games. Expectations weren’t very high but there was hope that they would start to take a step forward and make solid progress in their rebuild. The Magic started the season looking like a playoff threat and were the surprise team of the first month after an 8-4 start which included big wins over Cleveland and San Antonio. That stretch however was completely unrepresentative of how their season would pan out and they finished with a bottom 5 record in the league. For most young teams I can see a sense of direction and progress but Orlando is one team that really confuses me. Expect a big fire sale this offseason as they try to clear out and start fresh again.  
  
**—Milwaukee Bucks** W/L Record: 44-38
The Milwaukee were predicted to win 46 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 49 games. There was excitement around the team that they could be a legitimate dark horse and Giannis could push himself into the MVP conversation, which admittedly appeared possible early but the Bucks have just been mediocre since then. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions they were widely considered to be a top 5 seed or 6 seed with 20/30 voters placing them in this range. The early season addition of Bledsoe should’ve also helped them challenge for a high seed but ultimately they fell over the line to make their way into the playoffs. The pieces are there for the Bucks to be a better team and with a good coach next season It will be interesting to see how far they can go as Giannis is only getting better.  
  
**—Phoenix Suns** W/L Record: 21-61  
The Phoenix Suns were predicted to win 27 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 30 games. They weren’t a team seen as a big threat or a squad ready to make a leap but they weren’t meant to be the outright worst in the league. For this reason despite not having a specifically impressive total of wins to meet expectations there was optimism around the Devin Booker lead Suns and fans really haven’t seen any of that. Its another disappointing season for the franchise who haven’t really found their way again since the heartbreak of 2013-14. One thing to look forward to for the Suns is that they do have the leagues best odds for the number number pick and should they draft well could have a legit duo to build around going forward.  
  
**—Golden State Warriors** W/L Record: 58-24  
The Golden State Warriors were predicted to win 66 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 69 games. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30 voters expected the Warriors to finish with the leagues best record. It feels strange saying that a team with the leagues 3rd best record didn’t meet expectations but that ultimately is the reality. All thought Its a little hard to measure how the Warriors have performed this season with their starters missing significant time. Specifically two time MVP in Stephen Curry who missed 30 games in the year and the Warriors aren’t quite at the same level without him. Despite their clear injury problems I have to say that the Warriors have failed to meet expectation for the reason that they have struggled a lot more defensively this season and the fact that they didn’t finish first in the league. Additionally Klay Thompson and Draymond Greens performances in the closing games off the year without Steph were extremely below capitalised by a 40 point blowout loss to the Jazz.
———————————————————————————————————————————  
   
**Completely Didn’t Meet Expectations**  
  
**—Dallas Mavericks** W/L Record: 24-58    
The Dallas Mavericks were predicted to win 34 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 38 games. I remember at one point last season Mark Cuban making a statement that if his team was in the East then they wouldn’t be tanking, and if I recall correctly, competing for a low playoff spot. Well Dallas didn’t even come close to that and finished with one of the leagues worst records. Dennis Smith Jr had some solid moments in his rookie year and Mavericks fans cant be disappointed with how he played, Dirk Nowitzki had a great season at his age and Harrison Barnes continues to play well as the number one offensive option. Dallas isn’t a team I see going back to the playoffs very soon and yes they were tanking but playing 10 games below expectation is clearly not meeting expectations at all.  
  
**—Cleveland Cavaliers** W/L Record: 50-32   
The Cleveland Cavaliers were predicted to win 53 games in the preseason with USA Today expecting them to win as many as 56 games. The majority of people tipped them to retain their crown as the Easts best team overcoming competition from Boston. Their opening night roster was considered one of the deepest in the league with a great group of experience veterans and solid role players. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions they were a consensus top two team in the East make the finals for a fourth consecutive season. You might think its harsh to place Cleveland so low when comparing things with their win expectations but in my mind the fact that the Cavaliers were underperforming so seriously to the extent where they needed a complete roster turnaround at the deadline speaks for itself. One of the biggest disappointments was Isaiah Thomas played very far below expectations when finally healthy and was traded after just 15 games. Clevelands form leading into the playoffs may have lead to people forgetting how bad they were early in the year but in the grand scheme of things they did not have a great regular season. It will be interesting to see how Cleveland perform in the playoffs and whether they can prove once more that their regular season efforts are irrelevant.  
  
**—Memphis Grizzlies** W/L Record: 22-60    
The Memphis Grizzlies were predicted to win 38 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 41 games. While many people were thinking of the Grizzlies as a team to slip out of the playoffs very few expected such a dramatic decline. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 2 voters even predicted the Grizzlies to finish as the 5th seed in the West! The injury to Conley surely didn’t help but it wouldn’t have made this huge an impact in my opinion. While they were expected to compete and make things difficult for teams challenging a playoff position the Grizzlies have not done such at all and even fired their coach early in the season. Some question whether a healthy Conley, Gasol and new draft pick will be enough to give Memphis another playoff run but to be honest I don’t think Its enough and they face a long road back to contention.   
  
**—Charlotte Hornets** W/L Record: 36-46
The Charlotte Hornets were predicted to win 42 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 44 games. Many considered this roster to be a big upgrade on their 2015-16 squad which was tied for the 3rd best record in the East but for whatever reason they have just failed to perform this year. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions they were expected to by 27 of 30 voters to features in playoff action most likely as a 6 or 7th seed. The future is bleak for the Hornets with many question marks regarding the teams direction including what will happen with Kemba and Howard. Monk has ultimately had an underwhelming season and I believe they will be tanking next year and finish in the leagues bottom 5.  
    
———————————————————————————————————————————   
  
**No Idea** (I didn't really want to do a category like this but I'm so conflicted on where to rank San Antonio.  
  
**—San Antonio Spurs** W/L Record: 47-35   
The San Antonio Spurs were predicted to win 54 games in the preseason with USA Today expecting them to win as many as 57 games. After a great playoff run that ended in disappointment following an injury to Kawhi Leonard the Spurs entered the season as one of the favourites for the championship and another great season. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 29/30 voters expected San Antonio to finish as a top 4 seed in the Western conference. All these signs point towards this season having been a massive failure for the Spurs but we all know what happened. 
  
These predictions were made with the assumption that Kawhi Leonard would play out the entire season. Ultimately I think what they have been able to do this season while dealing with an injury for so long this season has been enough to not be considered a big failure but in the end of the day what they achieved was still not what we planned. Their 20 year streak of 50 wins came to and end as well but their playoff streak lived on. LaMarcus Aldridge deserves tremendous recognition and respect for what he has been able to help San Antonio achieve this year as the number one option. The Spurs are the hardest team to rank for me.

",5507,356,2018-04-12,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8bnnqc/oc_every_nba_team_ranked_by_how_well_they_have/
nba,"Opinion: Having two teams represent the same city is incredibly lame, and takes away from a core component of sports fandom: regional pride.","Los Angeles is obviously large enough to financially support two basketball teams, that's not my point.  My point is that a major contributing factor to why someone becomes a fan of a team is the pride that they take in their home city/region.  The reason I'm a Blazers fan isn't because I like the players or I like our branding - it's because I'm from Portland, I love my home city, I love the team that represents us and I want to talk shit to you about yours.



I can't blame Angelenos for hating the Clippers because I would hate another team coming into my town and attempting to confuse the regional attachment that is the primary driving factor behind my fandom.  Attempting to weaken the association between the Trail Blazers and Portland would get them run out of town.  Obviously the Clippers are putting profit from media attention within the ridiculous LA market ahead of the spirit of sports in general; I can't blame business owners from prioritizing making more money, but I can call them lame as fuck for doing so.



Two options:

1. Develop your own regional branding, like the Nets did.  Move to Inglewood in 2024 and become the SoCal Clippers.  Make OC and SD county fans question whether they feel represented by ""Los Angeles"" or ""Southern California"".  If Golden State can handle the challenge of uniting the many cities of the Bay Area by naming their team after the entire fucking state then the Clippers can be called SoCal Clippers.

2. Get out of town.  Relocate to Seattle and become the Supersonics.  They would without question have more fans in Seattle then they have in LA.",5482,1300,2020-09-17,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/iuop4w/opinion_having_two_teams_represent_the_same_city/

&gt;Jan. 25, 2019; Weston, Massachusetts

&gt;Kyrie Irving invited his old friend Kevin Durant for dinner at his mansion, a seven-bedroom spread in the woods of suburban Boston that did not feel particularly lived in. This was the night before the two-time defending-champion Warriors played the Celtics on network television, and Kyrie was battling the flu. That didn’t stop the wine from flowing, because Kyrie was a gracious host — Michael B. Jordan planned to stop by when he was in town — and nothing could stop Kyrie from getting what he wanted, which was to move the hell out.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Going home and doing good had lingered in Kyrie’s mind, and the Brooklyn Nets were a team he and KD could manipulate — two max-salary slots, a flexible general manager, a few pieces, maybe even some room for their friend DeAndre Jordan — while Kyrie built a house in Jersey for his daughter, and perhaps more children yet, to grow up in. KD told a confidant that he didn’t think the Warriors would get any better if Steve Kerr couldn’t hold Draymond Green accountable for his outbursts, and that he was occasionally irked when Steph got so much attention from the media and from the fans. Kyrie and KD, on the cusp of their free agency, shared a loner’s longing to settle down but look straight ahead.

&gt;""He didn’t like what his situation was,"" KD later said, ""and me either in Golden State. And it was just like, ‘Hey, man, let’s just see how this would work. Let’s try it out.’ And DJ wanted to play with us to be that center for us that can kinda hold it down, and play for something, really — play for a team that’s going somewhere, not just keep moving around and bouncing around to leave.""

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Having left OKC nearly three years earlier and experiencing the rage of its fans upon his ""revenge game"" with the Warriors, KD didn’t feel as bad about bailing on a franchise and its fan base. As he advised the All-Star Gordon Hayward on his 2017 free-agency choice to leave behind the team that drafted him, ""You don’t owe anybody anything."" And by 2019, KD’s own Warriors teammate Andre Iguodala had guilt-free advice for his friend. ""At this point, f--- everybody,"" Andre told him. ""That’s including management, anybody — from this team to that team, fans, whoever. Do whatever makes you happy, man, and don’t feel like you’re letting anybody down with any decision that you make.""

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;KD would follow Kyrie’s lead. That night in the suburbs, he even ate a vegan burger for the first time. ""I could f--- with this,"" he said. A super-team was starting to be formed, over a side of kale salad and... clink.

&gt;KD and Kyrie went upstairs to the playroom, shared a vegan smoothie, shot a Nerf ball into a toy hoop and played NBA2K. Controlling miniature versions of themselves and their teammates, like marionettes, they wondered how else they could string together a team that was going somewhere. ""And from that point,"" Kyrie said, ""we took the power back and put it in our hands.""",4718,634,2021-06-17,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o2130h/sullivan_kyrie_irving_invited_his_old_friend/

Harden, who had made 10 consecutive All-Star games, was dismayed at the snub, sources said.  
&gt;  
&gt;It didn't help that his former Nets teammates Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving had both been voted in as starters by the fans, media and players, while Harden was a distant fourth among Eastern Conference guards behind Irving, Donovan Mitchell and Jaylen Brown.

&gt;Still, NBA commissioner Adam Silver was prepared to name him as an injury replacement, sources said. Harden just had to give assurances that he would show up and play in the game. Days went by without Harden's answer. He was pouting. By the time Harden sent word that he would accept the invitation, Silver had moved on, naming Toronto Raptors forward Pascal Siakam as the replacement for an injured Durant.

nba,The NBA does a horrible job in teaching the game at the fundamental level,"I was listening to the Thinking Basketball podcast the other day where the topic was “how to make the NBA better” in respect to the ratings drop. One thing the podcaster noted was that in Curling, they made sure on the broadcast that they could entice new viewers by calling the game at a fundamental level. Paying attention to schemes, explaining the sport and strategy, talking through the consequences of certain actions and more. They bring up the actual curlers themselves at a much less frequent rate than in the NBA. Why? Because the NBA is selling the players and not the sport.

My mom is a great example of this. She became a hardcore NBA fan 3-4 years back and watches 1-2 games a night in addition to Raptor games. She watches all the ESPN segments on YouTube and listens to some NBA podcasts. To this day she still doesn’t understand things like a pick and roll, Full court press, zone defence vs man to man etc. and It’s not because she’s not paying attention. She knows the rules a fair bit (like what’s generally a foul, travelling to a degree) just because of the repetition of viewing, but after viewing the game she takes the drama home instead of the sport. “The Nets don’t play well cause of Kyrie, Kawhi loves to load manage, LeBron gonna Trade his teammates”.

The national broadcasters don’t help. The “Back in my day”ism and constant complaints about the league sounds whiny and annoying to potential new fans. I feel like the NBA has the best talent in the league but they do a horrible job in explaining it to the basketball-impaired",4492,458,2019-12-25,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ef9sv0/the_nba_does_a_horrible_job_in_teaching_the_game/

Wonder when is the timetable for his return. Either way atleast it appears it won’t be a long time before he gets back and he’s happy. That’s a good start. It’s also about time we had an elite defender.

ETA: looking at what this subject has become: I’ll just say this. Two things can be true at once

Yes Ben Simmons is probably dealing with mental issues…..much of it being amplified by the Philly environment. (Yes plenty of people gain all sorts of mental health issues in a certain working environment. [that happens all the time incase you don’t know ](https://www.cdc.gov/workplacehealthpromotion/tools-resources/workplace-health/mental-health/index.html) ) 

And yes, Rich Paul and Kutch could have decided to use that as a way to leverage Ben’s situation and get out of Philly. 

Philly environment is similar to New York, and we all see how NY is currently treating Julius Randle. players are under EXTRA  pressure when playing in the top cities with passionate/die hard fans and it could be mentally taxing, along with the pressure that comes with being on a contender *anyway*. Playing in New York with all that pressure is clearly weighing on Julius, and I’m assuming the same thing occurred with Ben in Philly. Joel Embiid dealt with it and became a better leader. That won’t be the case for everyone 

**let me say this too** cause many are saying “**well NY is going to be cruel to Ben too!**” let me make this clear: New York does not care about the nets. I Born and raised in Flatbush, Brooklyn. I can tell you for 100% fact Ben will be perfectly fine in this part of NY lol. I’m also sure you all see how Barclays Center is either dry or filled with opposing teams fans. James Harden left this city in the midst of controversy and not many in the city cared enough to ridicule him. He didn’t get that NY backlash that you’d expect from a superstar leaving New York. That should tell you all you need to know. 

Granted, all of this will attract bondy, berman and some other NY media trolls to bother Ben every  once in a while, but that’s about it. I bring up Julius Randle for a reason. What’s happening to him is what New York pressure looks like. 

Ben Simmons just isn’t made for that. that, along with doc comments, and what’s going on in his personal life(his sister has on more than one occasion, blasted him on social media, and that Step brother situation which extremely personal) klutch used his issues as a way of getting him out of Philly.

#And in no way shape and form am I saying Ben is 100% innocent or that Philly was entirely wrong either. Ben played a role in why this all went sour. That cannot be disputed multiple sides made mistakes along the way. Philly is a passionate sports city. That much is understood.

That doesn’t mean, however, that his issues aren’t real, they were probably just leveraged to his advantage. Klutch probably doesn’t even consider this taking advantage of a sensitive subject. **They just see it as business**. NBA is a cut throat business and like every other billion dollar brand; The agents/lawyers/everyone involved are looking out for themselves and their money.  Ben Simmons is Rich Paul’s money so you should all know how this goes by now

Rich isn’t stupid, either, fully aware he probably had a way of gaining leverage for Ben. Given the circumstances in Philly, Ben’s personal life, [and the amount of criticism he’s taking ](https://youtu.be/41AbwAMglZM) rich was looking after his $100 million man and again; **Business is business** in the end. **It isn’t right**, I deal with mental health issues and have been going through it since a teenager, so trust me I know. It must be said Again: i think we forget that sports leagues are no different than  other billion dollar businesses that creates celebrities figures (and we **ALL KNOW** Hollywood can be ruthless) The player empowerment era doesn’t help either. Players are looking out for self and their agents will find any leverage they can.








TL;DR. Ben Simmons can very well have issues, but they were leveraged by his camp to get him out of a bad situation while gaining some sympathy since he was being heavily criticized. I personally didn’t want this on my team, especially next to Kyrie, but it is what it is now. Can only hope he’s happy and ready to play which it appears he is. This can very well also end in disaster which is what I’m aware of as well. I did not want Ben’s problems but what can nets fan really do now except hope for a miracle?",4402,1209,2022-02-11,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/sq4t4p/bontemps_sean_marks_says_ben_simmons_was_in/
nba,(OC) What if the NBA eliminated the last-place franchise after each season?,"What could raise the stakes (and lower the incentive for tanking) more than the threat of a team’s complete deletion from existence? In this alternate reality, the NBA removes the franchise that comes in last each season. This means the league continuously shrinks until there is just one team left.

In order to find that one team, we’ll say that this system started 29 seasons ago (as there are 30 teams). We’ll use their real-world records to determine who the eliminated franchise is.

Now, ideally, I’d only look at the games that non-eliminated teams played against each other. However, it’s incredibly difficult to sift through, say, 20 teams’ schedules to look for their records against *each other* by removing their results against the 10 teams that no longer exist. I have no idea how to do that efficiently. Instead, I will use their full, real-world, 82-game records for the first 20 seasons. Then, when there are just 10 teams left, I will only use their records *against each other* as if they were the only teams in the league.

The team that made it farthest in the real world is declared the champion. **The *Thunder* win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* in the Finals.** The Pacers win the East because, in the real world, they won one playoff game while the Knicks got swept.

---

**2011-12 (Year Twenty-Three):** The New Orleans Hornets come in last place in the eight-team NBA at 4-16. **The Hornets are permanently removed from the NBA.

**2014-15 (Year Twenty-Six):** The Los Angeles Lakers come in last place in the five-team NBA at 3-10. Things are good. **The Lakers are permanently removed from the NBA.** Both conference champions must be changed to the longest-lasting (or best) non-eliminated team. The team that made it farthest in the real world is declared the champion. **The *Spurs* win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* for the third consecutive year.** The Pacers have lost five consecutive Finals. They didn’t even make the playoffs in the real world, but won the East because the Knicks went 17-65.

---

**2015-16 (Year Twenty-Seven):** The New York Knicks come in last place in the four-team NBA at 1-6. They spent six seasons in a two-team Eastern Conference, but didn’t manage to win it once. They didn’t gain any championships or extra conference titles out of this entire experiment. It’s somewhat of an accomplishment to make it this far, but it doesn’t really get more hollow than this, Knicks fans. **The Knicks are permanently removed from the NBA.** **The *Thunder* win the championship by defeating the *Pacers* in the Finals.** That’s six straight, Indiana.

---

**2016-17 (Year Twenty-Eight):** The Oklahoma City Thunder, one year after winning their third championship in six years, come in last place in the three-team NBA at 1-5. **The Thunder are permanently removed from the NBA, and the league is down to two teams.** **Those teams face each other in the Finals, where the *Spurs* yet again defeat the *Pacers*.** Seven straight.

---

**2017-18 (Year Twenty-Nine):** Two teams left. The San Antonio Spurs and the Indiana Pacers. The Spurs have won eight championships over the last twenty-eight years, four of which were against the Pacers. They play just two games against each other to decide the last team standing. [The first game is a thriller in Indianapolis. The Spurs are up by two in the final minute, but Victor Oladipo drains a three with ten seconds left to put the Pacers ahead. The Pacers hang on to win by three.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/201710290IND.html) The second game is a bit less exciting. [After a strong third quarter in San Antonio, the Pacers are able to hold off the Spurs to sweep the season series.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/201801210SAS.html) That means two things: **The San Antonio Spurs are permanently removed from the NBA**, and… **THE INDIANA PACERS ARE THE SURVIVOR! THEY ARE THE LAST REMAINING NBA TEAM!**

---

So what changed in this world?

The Spurs and Thunder won an extra three championships and the Lakers won an extra two. The Pacers won the last one by default. Nobody else gained a championship. The old Charlotte Hornets won an Eastern Conference title then immediately left town never to return. The 76ers gained a fuckton of extra Eastern Conference championships. The Pacers lost seven consecutive Finals. Despite having a single-digit number of teams, this league doesn’t really have much less parity than the real NBA in the last few years. Somehow.

---

What can we learn from this experiment?

The Bucks know how to be bad for a long time while not being the absolute worst?

The Knicks can’t win the East even if there’s only one other team to compete with?

The Pacers have to be **literally the only team left in existence** in order to win an NBA championship?

/u/InMyBrokenChair has to get back to his schoolwork?

nba,Who else is HYPED for Bucks / Nets on Saturday?,"This is going to be the first great match-up in the East after all the snooze-fests we had to endure in the first round. 

What's on the line?

A Bucks team that has been disappointed over and over as a contending team over the past two years, losing to lower seeds in the Raptors and Heat and never getting to the finals.  Another early-round exit would be brutal after all the moves they've made, particularly adding Jrue Holiday this year. 

A Nets team with the most polarizing superstars joining together. They won't stop hearing it, at least from the fans, if they bow out. 

Either of these teams would be a finals-worthy team and it all starts Saturday night!",4368,786,2021-06-03,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nrhmdw/who_else_is_hyped_for_bucks_nets_on_saturday/

nba,"Markief Morris on why Ben Simmons has improved his play recently, ""“Healthy. He finally got his legs under him. He was off for two years. Y’all wouldn’t give him a chance, y’all want to criticize him after every fu***** game ...”","&gt;After not scoring in double figures the first nine games of the season — and causing much handwringing among fans and pundits alike, Ben Simmons is on a roll. In the last five games, Simmons has averaged 14.6 points, 7.0 rebounds, 6.4 assists, 1.6 steals, 1.2 blocks and shooting nearly 80% (78.6% to be precise) overall. He’s shooting only 53.8% from the line but all those numbers are well in line with his career numbers, other than shooting percentage. He’s way above his career number which is 56.1.  
&gt;  
&gt;The sample is getting less small, too. Moreover, Simmons game is building.  
&gt;  
&gt;Markieff Morris defended Simmons’ slow start and explained why he’s not surprised by what looks like a sudden change in his teammate’s play. He had one word to describe it.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Healthy. He finally got his legs under him. He was off for two years. Y’all wouldn’t give him a chance, y’all want to criticize him after every fu\*\*\*\*\* game ...” Morris told the media. ““But when a guy don’t play two years — because obviously y’all wouldn’t know because none of y’all played in the NBA, he had to get his body right. Contact every night, he’s playing 30-plus minutes, it takes time.”

nba,[OC] What if every NBA player played for their local team?,"A few days ago, there was an interesting post with the title [""If every active NBA player played for their home state.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6slr09/if_every_active_nba_player_played_for_their_home/) I liked the idea behind that post, but I thought that it could have been improved in a couple ways.

The first issue was that it was done by state, which I thought was boring. Too many states don't have enough players to even make a lineup of NBA players, and a few states like California produce an enormous number of players. It would be more interesting to use the 30 NBA teams instead of the 50 states. The second problem was that using place of birth was kind of silly; there's no reason to claim Stephen Curry for Ohio when he grew up in and identifies with North Carolina. It's hard to tell where players are actually from, especially since so many basketball players move between high schools (often across multiple states) so I decided to use the *first* high school a player attended as a reasonable proxy for where that player came from.

To do this, I found the first North American high school that I could find for each player in the league, mostly using Wikipedia. I ignored international players who only came to the United States for one year of high school and I ignored fake schools like Prime Prep. After that, I used [this tool](http://tjpeiffer.com/crowflies.html) to find the distance as the crow flies between each player's assigned high school and the closest current NBA arena. In order to differentiate between the Lakers and Clippers, I used the Clippers' proposed new stadium in Inglewood for them and left the Staples Center for the Lakers. Doing it this way produced a couple wonky results but in general I thought it worked well. To my surprise, there were at least five players local to 28 of the 30 teams in the league.

Without further ado, the teams:

**ATLANTA HAWKS**  
Eric Bledsoe / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Jae Crowder / Derrick Favors / Dwight Howard  
Bench: Lou Williams, Malcolm Brogdon, JaMychal Green, Al-Farouq Aminu, Jaylen Brown, DeMarre Carroll, Jeremy Lamb, Jodie Meeks, Malik Beasley, Kobi Simmons, Marcus Georges-Hunt, Jaron Blossomgame, Lorenzo Brown  
This would be a very unpleasant team to try to score against, and Lou Williams on the bench provides the offensive excitement that the starting lineup lacks.

**BOSTON CELTICS**  
Michael Carter-Williams / Noah Vonleh / Pat Connaughton / Andre Drummond / Nerlens Noel  
Bench: Kris Dunn, Luis Montero, Chris Boucher, Wayne Selden, Khem Birch, Jake Layman, Shabazz Napier  
This roster has a lot of players (twelve, of whom for some reason four are Trail Blazers), but unfortunately almost all of them are marginal NBA players at best, and the two best players play the same position. In particular, the wing depth on this team is ghastly.

**BROOKLYN NETS**  
Isaiah Whitehead / Danny Green / Lance Stephenson / Taj Gibson / Karl-Anthony Towns  
Bench: Kyle O’Quinn, Wade Baldwin IV  
The Nets’ location kills them here; there are a significant number of NBA players from near Brooklyn, but most of them are nearer Madison Square Garden than Barclays Center, so they end up on the Knicks. This team would have been helped by staying in New Jersey. As it is, this team is awfully thin, but at least it has Karl-Anthony Towns. Lance Stephenson will be around, too, just to keep things interesting.

**CHARLOTTE HORNETS**  
Chris Paul / Stephen Curry / Khris Middleton / T. J. Warren / Hassan Whiteside  
Bench: John Wall, J. J. Redick, Seth Curry, P. J. Tucker, Trevor Booker, Kent Bazemore, Brandon Ingram, Ish Smith, David West, Mason Plumlee, Montrezl Harrell, Raymond Felton, Troy Daniels, D. J. Augustin, DeAndre' Bembry, Miles Plumlee, Kadeem Allen, Isaiah Hicks, P. J. Dozier, Dennis Smith Jr., Torrey Craig, Reggie Bullock, Tim Quarterman, Jawun Evans, Brice Johnson, Sindarius Thornwell, Bam Adebayo, Ramon Sessions, Harry Giles, Kennedy Meeks  
This team’s guards are so good that John Wall has to come off the bench. There are a huge number of NBA players from the Carolinas, particularly great shooters. The frontcourt lags behind with the exception of Hassan Whiteside, but this team would score points in bunches regardless.

**CHICAGO BULLS**  
Shaun Livingston / Patrick Beverley / Andre Iguodala / Jabari Parker / Anthony Davis  
Bench: Dwyane Wade, Robert Covington, Wilson Chandler, Derrick Rose, Tony Allen, Evan Turner, Frank Kaminsky, Richaun Holmes, Iman Shumpert, E'Twaun Moore, Glenn Robinson III, Tyler Ulis, Jahlil Okafor, Abdel Nader, Milton Doyle, DeAndre Liggins, Sterling Brown, Chasson Randle, Alec Peters, Jack Cooley, Brandon Paul, Alfonzo McKinnie, Fred VanVleet  
I wouldn’t argue with you if you decided to slot in Bulls legends Derrick Rose and Dwyane Wade into the two starting slots, but I think starting Shaun Livingston and Patrick Beverley makes things more interesting. This team’s ceiling would be limited, given that it would be starting two Warriors bench players, but that starting lineup would be very tough defensively and at least move the ball well on offense.

**CLEVELAND CAVALIERS**  
T. J. McConnell / C. J. McCollum / Caris LeVert / LeBron James / Kosta Koufos  
Bench: Larry Nance, Terry Rozier, JaKarr Sampson  
Once again, LeBron gets a terrible supporting cast. At least it might be interesting to see what C. J. McCollum would be able to do with LeBron setting him up.

**DALLAS MAVERICKS**  
Marcus Smart / Wesley Johnson / C. J. Miles / LaMarcus Aldridge / Myles Turner  
Bench: Julius Randle, Pascal Siakam, Emmanuel Mudiay, Darrell Arthur, Quincy Acy, Jeremy Senglin, Jalen Jones, Luke Kornet, Joel Bolomboy  
This would be a profoundly uninspiring team to watch; a frontcourt of Julius Randle and Myles Turner might be interesting, and maybe you really love Pascal Siakam, but other than that there wouldn’t be much reason to tune in to see this team.

**DENVER NUGGETS**  
Reggie Jackson / Derrick White / Ron Baker / James Johnson / Jason Smith  
Colorado produces very little basketball talent, but the five players on the Nuggets resolve themselves into a lineup that works, more or less. At the very least, Reggie Jackson would be able to channel his inner Russell Westbrook.

**DETROIT PISTONS**  
Kay Felder / Jordan Crawford / Josh Jackson / Draymond Green / Al Horford  
Bench: JaVale McGee, Denzel Valentine, Monte Morris, Edmond Sumner, Kyle Kuzma, Derrick Walton, Matt Costello, Bryn Forbes  
This team is riddled with Michigan State alumni, and it might take calling in Tom Izzo to make things work. There are a number of players here who can work well in a system that takes advantage of their talents, which is something.

**GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS**  
Damian Lillard / Tyler Johnson / Aaron Gordon / Robin Lopez / Brook Lopez  
Bench: Jeremy Lin, Jabari Bird, Brandon Ashley, Isaiah Taylor, Ivan Rabb, Quincy Pondexter  
This lineup might have been unplayable before Brook Lopez decided to start shooting three-pointers. It might still be an awkward fit, but now it’s possible to look hard enough to see a workable team here. A healthy Quincy Pondexter would be very helpful, but that seems like a real gamble.

**HOUSTON ROCKETS**  
Tim Frazier / Jonathon Simmons / Jimmy Butler / Justise Winslow / DeAndre Jordan  
Bench: Kelly Oubre Jr., Johnathan Motley, Eric Moreland, Joe Young, Alex Caruso, Andrew Harrison, Damyean Dotson, Wesley Iwundu, De'Aaron Fox, Justin Jackson, Sheldon McClellan  
This team is hamstrung by the lack of quality big men to play alongside DeAndre Jordan. If Justise Winslow were to discover his jump shot, it would do wonders for an offense that might otherwise get bogged down due to lack of spacing.

**INDIANA PACERS**  
Mike Conley / Bradley Beal / Gordon Hayward / Zach Randolph / Cody Zeller  
Bench: Eric Gordon, George Hill, Jeff Teague, Gary Harris, D'Angelo Russell, Rajon Rondo, Patrick Patterson, Courtney Lee, Yogi Ferrell, David Lee, Patrick McCaw, Trey Lyles, Ben McLemore, Jayson Tatum, Josh McRoberts, Luke Kennard, V. J. Beachem, A. J. Hammons, Darius Miller, Semaj Christon, Shelvin Mack, Meyers Leonard, Caleb Swanigan  
This roster is extremely deep because it encompasses the basketball-rich states of Indiana and Kentucky along with southern Ohio and even locations as distant as St. Louis. With an established lineup of dependable veterans and ample young talent, this squad would be a playoff team in the real NBA.

**LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS**  
Russell Westbrook / James Harden / Trevor Ariza / Jared Dudley / Tyson Chandler  
Bench: DeMar DeRozan, Norman Powell, Allen Crabbe, Stanley Johnson, Arron Afflalo, David Nwaba, Jordan Bell, T. J. Leaf, James Ennis, Anthony Brown, Daniel Hamilton, Delon Wright  
This team’s frontcourt is surprisingly mediocre, but the guard depth is remarkable. Trevor Ariza gets the nod for the starting spot over DeMar DeRozan because DeRozan’s offensive abilities are less useful if he’s sharing the court with Westbrook and Harden.

**LOS ANGELES LAKERS**  
Jrue Holiday / Klay Thompson / Kawhi Leonard / Paul George / Dewayne Dedmon  
Bench: Amir Johnson, Nick Young, Tony Snell, Darren Collison, Solomon Hill, Justin Holiday, Tyler Dorsey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ike Anigbogu, Lonzo Ball, Stephen Zimmerman, Gary Payton II, Zach Collins, Nigel Williams-Goss  
This might be the easiest team to envision, since many of the good players on this team have already been connected to the Lakers, if only in the fever dreams of Lakers fans. On the whole this lineup might not be quite as flashy as the Clippers’ Rolls-Royce backcourt, but it has no real weaknesses to speak of. Lakers-Clippers games would certainly be exciting to watch.

**MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES**  
Cameron Payne / Otto Porter / Joe Johnson / Thaddeus Young / Marc Gasol  
Bench: Bobby Portis, Skal Labissière, Ian Clark, Brandan Wright, Anthony Tolliver, Tarik Black, Mangok Mathiang, Malik Monk, Johnny O'Bryant III, Corey Brewer, OG Anunoby  
There are plenty of big men here, but the lack of an NBA-level ball handler on this team is a glaring weakness for what would otherwise be a solid squad.

**MIAMI HEAT**  
Brandon Knight / Buddy Hield / Tim Hardaway / Jonathan Isaac / John Collins  
Bench: Gian Clavell, Udonis Haslem  
It’s surprising how little NBA talent South Florida produces, and interesting how much of it was on the old Heat in Udonis Haslem and James Jones. In spite of the very small roster, this actually resolves itself into a workable starting lineup.

**MILWAUKEE BUCKS**  
Devin Harris / Devin Booker / Wesley Matthews / Sam Dekker / Deyonta Davis  
Bench: Marcus Paige, Kevon Looney, Jamil Wilson, Vander Blue  
There’s not much to say except that this isn’t an NBA-caliber team. Other than Devin Booker nobody here is even particularly fun, unless you really love Sam Dekker’s social media presence.

**MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES**  
Tyus Jones / Kyle Korver / Doug McDermott / Harrison Barnes / Mike Muscala  
Bench: Jon Leuer, Henry Ellenson, Bronson Koenig, Rashad Vaughn, Cole Aldrich, Justin Patton, Nick Collison  
It may not be surprising that this team is on the whiter side, but it still is interesting to see just how white it is. We do get to see the reunion of the legendary Ames High duo of Doug McDermott and Harrison Barnes, which might be fun.

**NEW ORLEANS PELICANS**  
Elfrid Payton / Rodney Hood / Garrett Temple / Paul Millsap / DeMarcus Cousins  
Bench: Greg Monroe, Thon Maker, Al Jefferson, Langston Galloway, Damian Jones, Shawn Long, Jarell Martin, Elijah Millsap  
In much the same manner as the actual New Orleans Pelicans, this team has probably the best big men in the league and not much else to speak of. Paul Millsap and DeMarcus Cousins are good enough that things might work out for this team, anyway, but it might also flame out spectacularly.

**NEW YORK KNICKS**  
Kemba Walker / Kyrie Irving / Michael Kidd-Gilchrist / Tobias Harris / Joakim Noah  
Bench: Kenneth Faried, Maurice Harkless, Kyle Anderson, Sean Kilpatrick, Luol Deng, Tyler Lydon, Cheick Diallo, Lance Thomas, Dakari Johnson, Donovan Mitchell, Chris McCullough, Michael Young  
For Joakim Noah to ever become a decent player again might be too much to ask, but if he did, then this lineup would look decent.

**OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER**  
Alec Burks / Josh Richardson / Semi Ojeleye / Blake Griffin / Willie Cauley-Stein  
Bench: Willie Reed, Ekpe Udoh  
There are no actual point guards on this team, which seems as good a reason as any to experiment with running the offense entirely through Blake Griffin.

**ORLANDO MAGIC**  
Ben Simmons / Austin Rivers / Luc Mbah a Moute / Chandler Parsons / Joel Embiid   
Bench: Vince Carter, Marreese Speights, Shane Larkin, Dwayne Bacon, Antonio Blakeney, Okaro White, Matt Williams, Tony Bradley, Eric Griffin  
This team is interesting and promising, which is to say that it is the opposite of the actual Orlando Magic.

**PHILADELPHIA 76ERS**  
Kyle Lowry / Dion Waiters / J. R. Smith / Marcus Morris / Markieff Morris  
Bench: Tyreke Evans, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Wayne Ellington, Jameer Nelson, Ryan Arcidiacono, Charles Cooke, Derrick Jones Jr., Davon Reed, Malachi Richardson, Daniel Ochefu  
This team would be more than a little bit volatile, but it would be fun to watch.

**PHOENIX SUNS**  
Jerryd Bayless / — / Richard Jefferson / Alan Williams / Channing Frye  
There are not enough players here for a full team.  

**PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS**  
Isaiah Thomas / Avery Bradley / Terrence Ross / Kevin Love / Kelly Olynyk  
Bench: Zach LaVine, Jamal Crawford, Dejounte Murray, Joe Harris, Marvin Williams, Mario Chalmers, Spencer Hawes, Kyle Singler, Mike James  
Players from Seattle make up the overwhelming majority of this team; if the SuperSonics were resurrected, Portland would only have four players left (James, Love, Ross, Singler). In general players from Seattle tend to be gunners, and the issue of there only being one ball might create problems with this team.

**SACRAMENTO KINGS**  
Ryan Anderson / Luke Babbitt / Cameron Oliver / D. J. Wilson / Marquese Chriss  
Somehow all five players on this team are power forwards, so these positions might as well be assigned at random. This team would not be very successful.  

**SAN ANTONIO SPURS**  
T. J. Williams / Jordan Clarkson / André Roberson / Taurean Prince / John Henson  
Bench: Jarrett Allen, Royce O’Neale  
The Mavericks and Rockets take most of the talent in Texas, which leaves rather little left for the Spurs. Jordan Clarkson would presumably have to absorb much of the offensive load here.

**TORONTO RAPTORS**  
Cory Joseph / Jamal Murray / Andrew Wiggins / Tristan Thompson / Dwight Powell  
Bench: Nik Stauskas, Thomas Bryant, Tyler Ennis, Dillon Brooks, Andrew Nicholson  
Replacing Thomas Bryant with Kelly Olynyk and Chris Boucher would turn this team into a Canadian national team. It’s not a bad team, and if Andrew Wiggins were to decide that he wanted to prove his ability to lead a team, this would provide him with that opportunity.

**UTAH JAZZ**  
Frank Jackson / C. J. Wilcox / Josh Huestis / Jalen Moore / —  
There are not enough players here for a full team.

**WASHINGTON WIZARDS**  
Victor Oladipo / Will Barton / Kevin Durant / Carmelo Anthony / Ed Davis  
Bench: Rudy Gay, Jerami Grant, Michael Beasley, Justin Anderson, Jerian Grant, Jeff Green, Rodney McGruder, Malcolm Delaney, Treveon Graham, Dorian Finney-Smith, Chinanu Onuaku, Troy Williams, Josh Hart, Markelle Fultz, Frank Mason III, Malcolm Miller, Devin Robinson, Mike Scott  
Maryland produces more blue-chip basketball talent per capita than any other state in the country, and it shows here. Looking at all the players on this team, it’s hard to escape the conclusion that a college team with the ability to recruit all these players should be able to do very well. Perhaps it would help even more if that college were centrally located in Prince George’s County, where many of these NBA players are from.",2154,594,2017-08-15,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6tsy45/oc_what_if_every_nba_player_played_for_their/

&gt; For the 2022-23 campaign, billionaire Joe Tsai’s money-losing franchise had sold roughly 5,500 season tickets at the 17,732-seat Barclays Center, according to an NBA owner and an insider who both saw a recent confidential league report.

&gt; That’s well below last year’s total — which insiders estimated between 8,000 and 9,000 — and lands the Nets in last place among the NBA’s 30 teams, according to league insiders.

&gt; Last season, single-game sales buttressed the season ticket total to help the Nets finish 10th in average paid attendance, according to NBA confidential financials obtained by The Post — not far behind crosstown rival Knicks. The Nets drew 14,919 per game, a 26.3% spike from the previous non-pandemic year, generating $2.15 million in average net gate receipts, a 108.5% increase year-over-year, according to the data.

&gt; Despite last season’s soaring attendance, the Nets and Barclays Center lost between $50 million and $100 million, The Post reported exclusively, among the worst in the league.

nba,Native players in NBA history (there are more than you think),"Here are the 14 Native players I am aware of in NBA history, but every time I make a post like this at least one more player is brought to my attention. They are in chronological order based on when they entered the league.

**Bob Harrison:** Harrison was the primary SG during the Lakers' early run of titles with George Mikan ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/harribo02.html)). He was a 1x All-Star and a 3x champion, but he's most famous for hitting a [half-court bomb of a buzzer beater](https://youtu.be/X9feuTd3XJk) to win Game 1 of the 1950 Finals. He was Hočąk, and I've read *""While with the Lakers, Harrison served as president of the Minnesota-based North American Indian Society in 1951-52. Also during his time in Minneapolis, on a night when Harrison was honored by his team, a number of local tribes presented him with a deerskin jacket.""* He has said that he tanned dark, and once when he was in the Marines he was made to sit in the back of the train because authorities thought he was black.

**Gene Conley:** Conley was part of the Cherokee Nation ([link to his obituary in the Cherokee Phoenix](https://www.cherokeephoenix.org/news/2-sport-star-gene-conley-dies-at-age-86/article_d544a8d2-9668-5be9-9a02-b18090647bc3.html)), which he was connected to through his mother's side of the family. Conley was a 3x NBA champion with the Celtics ('59-61), but he was more famous as a 6-ft-8 MLB pitcher where he was a 4x All Star (*including playing in both ASG's in '59*) and a World Series champ in 1957 with the Braves. Here are his [career stats in the NBA](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/conlege01.html).

**Phil Jordon:** He was a decent center from '59-62 ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordoph01.html)), and his biggest claim to fame was that he did NOT play in the game where Wilt scored 100 points. Jordon was the Knicks' starting center in '62 --and their only starter taller than 6-ft-6-- but he drank an entire case of beer the night before the game and sat out ""sick"", so the already awful Knicks who had a horrible front court had no chance against the Warriors and Wilt who had a historic day of stat hoarding. 

**Gary Gray:** Gray was part of the Delaware Nation while growing up in Oklahoma. He played sparingly for the Royals during the '68 season ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/grayga01.html)) and was then selected by the Bucks in the 1968 Expansion Draft, but he never played beyond that 1 season in Cincinnati. 

**Sonny Dove:** Dove's mother was Mashpee Wampanoag and after he had a fantastic college career at St. John's, he was the #4 pick in the 1967 draft by the Pistons (*1 pick before Walt Frazier*). He played sparingly with Detroit for 2 years, then he went to the ABA's Nets for 3 seasons ('70-72), averaging 14 ppg and 8 rpg during his first 2 seasons in NY ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/doveso01.html)). His career ended early due to a bicycle accident, and he went on to earn his degree and announce St. John's games until his death in 1983. Dove and Gray did both play in a single game against each other during the '68 season ([box score](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196801300CIN.html)), playing a combined 3 minutes, so it's unlikely they were on the court at the same time unless they both appeared in the final minute of garbage time of Cincinnati's 20-point win.

**John Starks:** In this article about Ron Baker ([link](https://www.potawatomi.org/blog/2017/12/05/drive-day-sports-resume-built-leading-high-school-college-championship-games-new-york-knick-ron-baker-also-credits-native-heritage-success/)), Starks is referred to as ""Oklahoma born-and-raised Muscogee (Creek) Nation athlete John Starks"". He had an insane backstory that led to his NBA career (*4 different colleges, spent a couple years in 2 leagues that both collapsed, and the Knicks were forced to keep him in '90 when he got injured during a pre-season practice while attempting a dunk on Ewing*) who went on to be a beloved Knick who played with fiery passion and shot a ton of 3's. He was named an All Star in '94 when NY went to the Finals, was All-D in '93, and the '97 6th Man of the Year ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/starkjo01.html)). 

**Bison Dele:** According to Wikipedia, ""he was of African-American and Cherokee descent."" He was a decent rebounder and finisher near the hoop ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/delebi01.html)), but he's most well known as a player for winning a ring with the '97 Bulls. He had an extremely interesting personal life, playing multiple instruments, being an avid adventure traveler, flying planes, and dating Madonna, but his biggest headlines were made for his bizarre disappearance and presumed murder at sea in 2002.

**Cherokee Parks:** He was named after the Cherokee tribe of his great grandmother. As a player, he is most well-known for his college days at Duke where he backed up Christian Laettner during the '92 championship season, the year of the famous [Duke-UK game](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/1992-03-28-duke.html). As a pro, he played for 7 franchises in 9 seasons ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/parksch02.html)).

**Ron Baker:** Baker is a Citizen Potawatomi Nation tribal member and Navarre family descendent who attended Wichita State on a Potawatomi scholarship, joining the Shockers basketball team as a walk-on before honing his shooting to become a key player on their unexpected run to the 2013 Final Four. Despite going undrafted, he played for 3 seasons in the NBA ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bakerro01.html)).

**Kyrie Irving:** Irving is well known to modern NBA fans and is easily the best player on this list (*7x All Star, '12 ROTY, '14 ASG MVP, '16 champion - [career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/irvinky01.html)*). His mother was a Standing Rock Sioux and lived on a reservation before being adopted at a young age. She later died when Kyrie was 4 so he didn't have a connection to this part of his heritage for most of his life, but Kyrie and his sister Asia both joined the tribe at a naming ceremony in 2018 ([link](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24444427/kyrie-irving-embraces-native-american-heritage-sioux-naming-ceremony-nba)).

**Delonte West:** In [a 2009 interview](https://web.archive.org/web/20101203063552/http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/mailbox/delonte_mailbox_090203.html), West said he's part Piscataway and that his [""REDZ"" tattoo](https://bodyartguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Delonte_West_angels_tattoo.jpg) is short for ""Chief Redz"" due to his red hair. He had a 9-year NBA career ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westde01.html)), most notably as the streaky-scoring SG on the '09 Cavs who went to the ECF. West has had some well-documented, post-career mental health issues.

**Aaron Gordon:** According to [this interview](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/os-xpm-2014-07-24-os-magic-fit-program-david-whitley-0725-20140724-story.html) before his rookie season, Gordon has an Osage Indian great-great-grandfather who was 7 feet tall. Gordon is an athletic and versatile PF with injury issues ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/gordoaa01.html)). He's probably most well-known for his phenomenal performances as a close runner-up in the 2016 and 2020 Dunk Contests, both of which he arguably coulda/shoulda won.

**Lindy Waters III:** Waters has a very close connection to both his Kiowa and Cherokee roots ([short video &amp; article](https://www.nba.com/thunder/story/honoring-the-native-tradition-211119)). He is from Oklahoma, played at Oklahoma State, and after a year in a couple small pro leagues, he made it to the NBA in February of 2022 with the Oklahoma City Thunder ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/waterli01.html)).

**MarJon Beauchamp:** Beauchamp is a descendent of both the Mission Indians and the La Jolla Band of Luiseno Indians. His backstory is unique and truly inspiring. He was houseless while growing up, went to multiple high schools in Seattle and Arizona, bypassed college to train for the 2021 draft but the gym he was training at shut down due to COVID-19, then he played 12 games at a CC and a season for the G League Ignite, and after success with the Ignite he was drafted 24th overall by the Bucks in 2022 ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/beaucma01.html)). He wears #0 to remind himself that he ""came from nothing"".",1354,172,2022-11-24,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/z3ja5n/native_players_in_nba_history_there_are_more_than/

GoNets,How the Nets offense SHOULD work (LONG post with lots of video),"Hey ya'll, I wrote this up because I finally figured out how to make gif/streamable things. I like Kenny Atkinson's offense and its roots, but the Nets just haven't figured it out yet. I definitely think the system good for the future when the Nets actually get NBA players. This is reposted from my [blog thing](https://ignisyon.wordpress.com/2017/01/23/kenny-atkinson-offense-1-23/) and formatted for reddit. This is the first long writing on the Nets I've done ever. Yes, it's long. It's a good poop read. Hope you guys learn something from this

**How Kenny Atkinson has built a modern offense for the Brooklyn Nets, now and for the future**

The Brooklyn Nets are in flux. By rebuilding, the Nets are not just signing new players and staff. The entire franchise is changing. The players, head coach, and GM are the most noticeable changes, but the makeover of the franchise runs deeper. Sean Marks and Kenny Atkinson have referred to the current Nets as a “program.” In college basketball, Coach K and the Duke Blue Devils are a program. So are Rick Pitino and Louisville, Roy Williams and UNC, Jay Wright and Villanova, and many others. But under the Nets’ program, there likely are less shady under the table deals than in men’s college basketball. In the NBA, the San Antonio Spurs are the “program,” which is Sean Marks’ source for branding the Nets as such. This is year one of the new Brooklyn Nets program. Kenny Atkinson is trying to install and teach a complicated motion offense, so there obviously have been growing pains. The record shows that.

In Kenny Atkinson, Sean Marks hired a grandchild of the Gregg Popovich coaching tree, and a child of the Mike D’Antoni tree. There’s probably some weird coaching tree incest thing going on there. Atkinson has adopted principles of the Hawks offense with the Nets, with a few D’Antoni-style philosophical strategies. The offense is the fastest paced in the league, and while it has not led to success for the Nets,  it has kept them competitive. In a team devoid of stars and sheer talent, the offense attempts to put players in situations to succeed. It’s a breath of fresh air, compared to when Lionel Hollins would run Deron Williams off the ball, and have players take turns on stagnant isolation plays. The Nets are finally modern.


**The Offense - Philosophy and Roots**

The Nets offense this season is complex. So here’s way too much information on a team that hasn’t been successful. Kenny Atkinson took the skeleton of the Hawks “Spurs East” offense, and injected it with D’Antoni style speed. It’s pace and space meets Spurs-esque motion. I’d love to think of a cool name for the offensive system, but I think winning has to come first before doing that. With the Hawks sets, the players often did not run any set plays. The system relies on the ability of the players to read and react to the opposing defense. The five players on the floor read when to screen, cut, pass, or attack, and know where to find each other during all the movement. It takes a lot of teamwork. For the Spurs, that teamwork is part of their culture. The Hawks finished their season 6 games under .500 when Mike Budenholzer took over. The offense takes time to learn and build chemistry.

In the Nets current offensive system, there really are no set plays in half court sets, just options. The D’Antoni philosophy comes into play in transition, affecting the team's shot selection and clock control. Shots can come freely from all around the perimeter early in the shot clock, almost as soon as a player crosses the sideline hash mark. The Nets will also use dribble drives to the rim to set up open shooters or find cutters as well. This still leaves room for Brook Lopez post-ups, and Kilpatrick or Bogdanovic creating their own shots off the bounce. Anyone can be a ball handler and initiate the matchup, depending on the matchup. Atkinson said earlier in the season that if a player has a good look at the basket, he should [shoot his shot.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YWaN-SHuS3M/hqdefault.jpg)

Additionally, the Nets offense borrows from the Daryl Morey-Houston Rockets style of shot selection. They take plenty of threes, try to get layups and floaters in the paint, and try to get to the free throw line. The mid range shot may not be completely taboo, but the most efficient shots come from the perimeter and in the paint.


**Strong and Weak Sets**

The Nets run most (probably about 70%) of their offense starting with the “Strong” and “Weak” sets. These two sets come from Popovich and the Spurs, and were the foundation pieces of the Hawks offense. Both of these sets use a four out, one in initial setup, involving movement of the ball from side-to-side, followed by additional action. In Strong, a guard initiates the action by dribbling to a side with a big at the top of the key and another wing on the opposite side. The other big is on the block, with the fifth player, usually a shooter, in the opposite corner, where the ball starts moving (the strong side.)
[Strong positioning](https://i.imgur.com/hIue93k.jpg)

The Weak set has a similar side-to-side movement to start a posession, but instead of the corner wing on the same side as where the ball starts, he’s in the opposite corner, or the weak side. The ballhandler that initiates the play is usually the point guard.
[Weak positioning](https://i.imgur.com/HQbBKVo.jpg)
 
The ball is swung from the primary ball handler, to the opposite side. From here, there are different ways to attack, and it’s up to the players to read the defense. This wing can look to dump it down low to the big to get a post-up or slip for a layup. The Hawks do this [here, in their Strong set.](https://gfycat.com/EnergeticGraveGemsbok)
  
This is a favorite entry point for a Brook Lopez post up. In previous years, Lopez had difficulty even getting position for post ups, starting to back down a few feet inside the three point line. Lopez or Booker can usually get the ball right on the block if they ask for the ball coming out of a Strong or Weak side set. The post pass can come early in the shot clock, allowing enough time for additional movement or a reset.

If the big can’t find proper position for a clear entry pass, the wing in the opposite corner can curl off of a double stagger screen to the top of the three-point line. From here, the wing that receives the ball can shoot it quickly or attack off the dribble. Atlanta had Kyle Korver running off this action, usually. [Korver could come off the double screen for a three at the top of the arc.](https://gfycat.com/GregariousActiveGemsbuck)

[Or he could continue moving on the dribble, looking for his own shot...](https://gfycat.com/DeterminedAgreeableAnnelid)
 
[...or finding an open teammate diving to the basket.](https://gfycat.com/MammothOldHalicore)
 
For the Nets, Joe Harris, when he starts, is usually the wing in the strong side corner. Similar to Korver, Harris comes off of screens hard. He usually opts to take the ball off the dribble for in-between shots, rather than shooting it right off the catch.

If that doesn’t work, the current ballhandler can initiate another set. Atlanta used the play horns as the secondary action off the initial play, and that leaves even more options for scoring. It could lead to a give and go with one of the big men at the elbow, an open shot or drive to the rim by the big or finding another teammate coming off an offball screen. From there, more motion can be initiated, and again, it’s up to the team to read and react to what the defense does. [They can run horns into a give and go...]

The Nets run strong in the following play, with Bogdanovic coming off a second double stagger screen. Dinwiddie cuts from the strong side on the initial action. [It leads to an open, but missed Trevor Booker three point shot in the corner.](http://streamable.com/m1b8z)

The Nets run a modification of the Strong set, and instead of running horns, [Bogdanovic uses Booker as a screener in the pinch post, leading to a Lopez open three.](http://streamable.com/hu4jy)

[Here, the Strong set swings the ball back across the court, where Dinwiddie recognizes the double and passes it to Lopez, who gets into the lane for a floater.](http://streamable.com/yehg2)

If the ball can’t be moved to the other side on the initial action, the corner player can come over and receive a handoff. Here, Kilpatrick is being denied the pass by Kidd-Gilchrist. [Booker hands it off to Bogdanovic, coming off a Dinwiddie screen, and forces a rushed pass after getting a quick double.](http://streamable.com/t4z4c)

[In this set, Kemba Walker denies the ball from Dinwiddie on the swing. This leads to Kilpatrick coming off a LeVert stagger screen, and he uses Booker as a pick and roll partner.](http://streamable.com/jnnkm)

The Weak set is similar to Strong, but can be used to get the point guard a good look, whereas Strong can be used for a wing player. In Weak, instead of the corner wing coming off a double stagger screen, the initial ballhandler comes off a screen, and can go to work from there. Jeff Teague was usually the guy doing this in Atlanta. His speed off of a screen from a big allowed him to initiate the offense, and create for himself or for his teammates.

[Here, the Weak side set leads to an Isaiah Whitehead-Quincy Acy pick and roll, with Acy forcing up a contested shot.](http://streamable.com/87gng)

After the initial screen action, the ball can be handed off to the screener, who can take it off the dribble. [Gustavo Ayon does that here.](https://gfycat.com/SleepyRegularKrill) Lopez does this sometimes for the Nets, and he can dribble to the rim or post up.

Atkinson has added his own flair to the Hawks offense by speeding things up and looking for early offense. The initial ball reversal can be done right as the players cross half court. Before the shot clock even reaches :20, the team may already have fired a shot from the perimeter, or found a big down low. This occasionally allows for an easy bucket or a quick switch, with the defense not really set coming off of their own offensive possession.


**Inbound Plays and Horns**

The Nets offense doesn’t run Strong and Weak sets every play. A common set in the NBA is Horns. The ball handler is met with the two bigs at the elbows, and the ball handler can initiate a pick and roll, drive, or set up more movement by passing it to a big in a triangle offense pinch post. There are a lot of (maybe endless) options coming out of Horns. [Caris LeVert uses Horns to set up a pick and pop for an open Quincy Acy three.](https://streamable.com/w38pk/)

[LeVert initiates horns again, with RHJ slipping the screen, and the defender Frank Kaminsky icing the ball handler. The rotation leaves Foye open in the corner for three.](http://streamable.com/otkko)

The Nets have had a lot of success coming out of time outs, which has been noticed by the YES crew. Atkinson seems to excel at inbounds play calls. Even if the players miss, they usually get a clean look or drive to the basket. [In this play, Kilpatrick comes off of a rip screen from Lopez to initiate a pick and roll right at the free throw line.](http://streamable.com/ibncb)

[Another inbounds play has Michael Kidd-Gilchrist fighting two stagger screens from Booker and Lopez, leading to an open Kilpatrick three.](http://streamable.com/aeupd)


**Drives, PNR, and Swings**

This is where the fast pace and D’Antoni style comes in. At any point in the offense, the players on the perimeter can come off the dribble and attack. While this may not always lead to an easy layup, it causes the defense to scramble, and may leave someone open on the perimeter for a three, drive or additional ball reversal. RHJ, in recent games, has been attacking the basket well, usually leading to him getting to the rim. Coming out of weak action, RHJ drives against Frank Kaminsky. This causes a rotation to the rim. [RHJ dumps it off to Acy, who swings it to Bogdanovic for three.](http://streamable.com/ji1ls)

[Ball reversal early in the shot clock allows Kilpatrick to drive to the basket and find Bogdanovic for the open three here.](http://streamable.com/6itr4)

Out of strong, weak or horns, pick and roll, or pick and pop can be initiated. There are some plays where the Nets run the pick and roll to start the possession. [Here, Whitehead finds Acy for an easy layup when Cody Zeller doubles the ballhandler.](http://streamable.com/bn79s)

[Dinwiddie denies the screen from Lopez, but Charlotte doubles on the drive again, and Dinwiddie finds a diving Lopez for the floater.](http://streamable.com/2soiz)


**Transition, Post-ups, and Isolation**

The Nets offense is so fast, that it seems like they’re always on a fast break. Zach Lowe of ESPN and Kevin O’Connor of the Ringer have commented on the occasional effectiveness of [the Trevor Booker coast to coast.](http://streamable.com/hihf7)

Atkinson has encouraged guys to push the ball. Any player (other than the centers) can bring the ball up the court and initiate the offense, or drive to the basket if the defense is napping. This is by design, as the offense hasn’t really used a dominant ballhandler.

The Brook Lopez post up can also set up the offense. Coming off an entry pass, Lopez can start backing down his defender. The entry passer can cut away from the basket and set a screen for another wing along the top of the three-point line. If Lopez faces up, there usually are shooters at the weak side wing and at the weak side elbow. Lopez has also shown an ability to find cutters that dive to the basket after an entry pass or down screen. The Spurs ran similar action with Tim Duncan, and are still doing so with LaMarcus Aldridge.

Sean Kilpatrick and Bojan Bogdanovic are the two players that use simple isolation the most. This may not be part of the motion offense, but it has been successful for both at some points. Kilpatrick does a decent job at using dribble moves to get to the rim or create enough space for a shot. Bogdanovic uses the threat of his three point shot to get defenses to decide on whether to stay on him, where he can use long strides to get past the defender, or make a sagging defender pay by shooting a jumper with space.


**So, is the offense any good?**

Considering the personnel the Nets have, the motion x pace and space system can really maximize players’ strengths, and put players in positions to succeed. The speed of the offense can catch defenses not paying attention, or can take advantage of mismatches early in the shot clock. The motion offense, in theory, makes everyone an offensive threat. There is less standing around and more movement to work for an open shot. The offense is not just about cutting to find an open shooter, contrary to what some may think. In a season where star power has never been more evident, the Nets have been competitive in games without having a fair counter to the likes of Harden, DeRozan, Curry and Durant. With the constant motion, the players have to read and attack.

For the future, I think that Kenny Atkinson’s offense can be successful, given the personnel. The Hawks won 60 games with the same offense. While they may not have gone to the NBA Finals, they shocked the league by being super-successful without having a bonafide megastar. With the NBA becoming longer and more athletic, a motion offense can create mismatches off of screen action, or draw defenders far enough to leave someone open. It keeps everyone on the court involved, with a lot of offensive possessions having all five players touch the ball. It is a far cry from the pounding of the basketball for 18 seconds, and a contested midrange shot with 6 seconds left on the shot clock. Nets fans are familiar with that.

That all sounds great, right? Ball movement, open shots, drives to the rim, and sharing really has caused the team to overcome their talent disparity, right? Obviously, it hasn't. An innovative, team-oriented system, adapted from two successful philosophies has had no major effect on the wins-loss column this season for Brooklyn. There are different scapegoats in the Nets’ current standing as a bottom dweller, in the standings and on the stat sheets. Obviously, Billy King is at the top of that list for the Nets’ current position. But on the court, the offense isn't always as smooth as described here. By trying to emulate the Hawks and Spurs, the Nets have a clear goal of the style they want. But with the current roster, there are some things to work on. I’ll be covering how the Nets offense can and has gone wrong this season in my next post.

nba,[Aldrige] The NBA is as talented and skilled as it’s ever been. So … why all the negativity?,"[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6019886/2025/04/01/nba-media-negativity-charles-barkley-shaq/?source=emp_shared_article)

&gt;Stephen Curry processed what was happening, and about to happen, in about a tenth of a second.

&gt;In his 1,009th NBA game, the future Hall of Famer curled off of a screen by Kevon Looney, in the fourth quarter against the Knicks in Madison Square Garden — an event game, in The World’s Most Famous Arena, as they like to say. Curry already had 25 points in three-plus quarters and had four 3-pointers. In other words, a typical Stephtacular night was brewing. And the Warriors were ahead late in the game when they ran an action to one side with Curry and Looney, who’ve been teammates for a decade.

&gt;Curry took the dribble handoff from Looney just behind the 3-point line. The Knicks, of course, sold out defensively, sending three players in Curry’s direction. When you hear about the “gravity” that Curry’s historic shooting prowess creates, this is what people are talking about. He tilts the floor because you can’t let him beat you, one last time, with one last 3. Because the “night-night” comes out afterward.

&gt;The Knicks’ center, Mitchell Robinson, was in no-man’s land. If he didn’t step up to Curry and challenge him, Curry could pull up for a long two, or step back and launch from behind the arc. But Robinson also had to watch Looney rolling to the basket. Robinson made his choice. He took a half-step toward Curry. Just a half-step.

&gt;That’s all the space Curry needed.

&gt;Curry then ended the game … not with a dagger 3, but with a pocket pass, between Mikal Bridges and Robinson, hitting the rolling Looney in stride for a dunk.

&gt;It was gorgeous, gorgeous basketball — observant, in the institutional knowledge all five players involved had of their opponents, and one another; immediate, as Curry observed and processed and decided and executed a series of moves in a matter of moments — and efficient, as Looney rolled, and dunked, one of the non-3-point shots that the advanced stats community cheers.

&gt;It was a Tuesday night in the NBA.

&gt;It was far from unique

&gt;Every night, in the best basketball league in the world, there’s a play, or a player, who makes you stop what you’re doing, and watch in awe.

&gt;No serious person can argue the skill level of today’s NBA players isn’t vastly superior to those of 10, 20, 30 and 40 years ago. More players can do more things with a basketball than ever. More people dribble it better. More people handle it better. More people pass it better. More people shoot it better and from a greater distance. With the possible exception of Wilt Chamberlain, there has never been anyone in the history of this league with the size and skill set of Victor Wembanyama, the Spurs’ young superstar.

&gt;**“I think we’re at the peak of basketball, in my opinion,”** 15-time All-Star and two-time NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant told *The Athletic.* **“I feel like the game is always going to evolve into something different. There’s going to be players that change the mindset of how to win a basketball game. Now, you see, I think the bigs are starting to come back around, where the most dominant bigs are the guys that you want to run an offense through and play off of. I just think the game is always evolving, and if you complain about it too much then you’re not going to see the beauty of what’s going on.""**

&gt;**“Obviously, nothing’s perfect, and there’s going to be complaints from different sides, with people wanting to see it in different ways. But for the most part, you’re seeing the growth. You’re seeing the players get better. You see it through, what, the last six champions have been different. There’s going to be complaints across the board, but I think the game’s in a good place.”**

&gt;Consider what Durant is saying for a minute. The game, in his view, has never been better. This is the apex of the 75-plus seasons of the NBA: the most athletic, the most efficient era of the game’s history. And, it would seem, among the most democratic. Even though Golden State won a fourth championship in 2022, outdueling Boston in six NBA finals games, the Warriors’ dynasty truly ended when then-Dub Durant tore his Achilles, and Klay Thompson ruptured his ACL, during their 2019 finals series with Toronto.

&gt;Since then, when the Raptors’ Kawhi Leonard led his team to its first NBA title, different superstars have taken their teams to the top — \[Redacted due to Sub Rules\] James (2020), Giannis Antetokounmpo (2021), Curry (2022), Nikola Jokić (2023) and Jayson Tatum (2024). You couldn’t find six more disparate talents who dominate a game in which they play in different ways. Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, sublime in his game, has the inside track to winning league MVP this season, in a two-man race with Jokić, who’s going for his fourth MVP in the last five seasons. There is, every night, something for everyone.

&gt;So … why aren’t we all celebrating?

&gt;Why does it feel like, as with most everything in American life these days, we are perpetually arguing with one another, balkanized when it comes to our NBA fandom? Many in the current generation of star players and coaches think the modern game is just fine, and that those who bring up concerns are simply haters, jealous of the money and attention and fame today’s stars receive. While many of those who critique today’s game think the modern player is a spoiled, overpaid, too-sensitive diva who needs to strap up and play 75-plus games as most stars did back in the day and ignore the recommendations of his team’s very well-paid and hip-deep medical staffs that push for load management to preserve the careers of the game’s best players.

&gt;(Then again, did the NBA’s elite stars of yesterday run 2.9 miles per game, like Tyrese Maxey has done this season?)

&gt;Why do so many bemoan all the timeouts, coach’s challenges, and load management — and, as ever, the avalanche of 3s? It’s not just Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal on “Inside the NBA”; it’s Chuck and Shaq at the barber shop. It’s anyone — and, these days, that feels like everyone — in the comments section. Why are the league’s ratings down? (In fairness, nearly every sports league, including the mighty NFL, has experienced ratings drops in the last few years. The league whose ratings are increasing dramatically is … the WNBA.)

&gt;Financially, the NBA has never done better. The league is about to begin an 11-year, $76 billion media rights deal with ESPN/ABC, NBC and Amazon, doing exactly what it hoped to do when negotiations began: nearly tripling its former deal. The new deal will end the league’s 40-year relationship with what is now Warner Bros. Discovery, but begins a new one with Amazon, which is, like NBC, and NBC’s streaming platform, Peacock, set to start broadcasting NBA games next season. Corporate America does not believe the league to be too boring or too woke to do business with it. Enormous business.

&gt;Clearly, most of today’s players agree with Durant’s take.

&gt;**“You know how it works,”** Curry told *The Athletic.* **“Sometimes, a narrative starts, and everybody starts to kind of feed into it, not actually come in with an informed kind of perspective. And if you’re not watching from night to night to night, and you kind of swan dive in and watch a game, you can say ‘Oh, yeah, this is different than my dad’s, or my parents’ NBA.’**

&gt;**“Yeah, it’s evolved. (But) the nuance of the game is still there. IQ still matters.”**

&gt;But the divide between present and past, between efficiency and the eye test, remains. No greater example of the divide is exemplified by what you think about 3-pointers.

&gt;What Golden State started with Curry and Thompson a decade ago, and that the Rockets pushed even further with their offense built around James Harden, is now the norm in the NBA. There is no end in sight as to how many 3s are too many 3s.

&gt;Boston’s averaging more than 48 3-point attempts per game this season, which would break the record of 45.38 3s per game set by the Rockets in 2018-19. The Splash Brothers’ prowess behind the arc turbo-jumped 3-point attempts league-wide a decade ago. Boston has taken the revolution further.

&gt;**“The game is evolving towards what’s most efficient, what’s best, what’s most successful,”** Nets wing Cam Johnson said during All-Star Weekend. **“And our job as players and coaches in the league is simply to win games, kind of by any means. So, if that requires shooting 50 3s, and that wins you a championship, then I’m going to shoot 50 3s, you know? So until another formula comes along to best that, then that’s what’s going to happen.”**

&gt;The 3 is just one way the game has fundamentally changed. The game is more open and freer than ever. This was engineered, through a series of rule changes in the late 1990s and early 2000s, designed to get the NBA out of the mosh pit it was in late last and early this century. Defenses were dominant, and defenders were able to push and shove and hand check to their hearts’ content. Average scoring collapsed, to a low of 91.6 points per game in the 1998-99 season – a lockout season, to be fair.

&gt;**“(Rick) Pitino kept saying ‘We’ve got to have freedom of movement,'”** recalled Billy King, the longtime NBA executive with the Pacers, 76ers and Nets, who served on one of the many Rules Committees of the time with Pitino, then the Celtics’ president, head coach and general manager.

&gt;And after almost two decades of rule changes that have eliminated all but the most rudimentary contact between defenders and ballhandlers, scoring has soared. Average scoring has risen more than a dozen points per game in the last decade alone. With so many people now proficient at shooting from deep, and more teams getting up 40 and 50 3-point attempts per game, defenses have to cover more space on the floor than ever. They are failing.

&gt;**“The skill set of the bigs has really opened up the floor,”** said Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau, one of the league’s top defensive tacticians.

&gt;**“In the ’90s, you had power forwards playing the small forward position, and it was really physical,”** he said. **“And there wasn’t spacing. As it evolved, with the rule changes, you started to see small forwards play power forward. And now, every team has a center that can play away from the basket, so it opens up the floor.**

&gt;**“Then, when you add great shooting to that, every screen that’s set, there’s probably going to be a slip. If your body position isn’t correct, you’re going to give up a layup. It puts a lot of pressure on people.”**

&gt;But, in acknowledging that the talent level in the NBA is higher than ever, you can conflate improved skill with an improved game. This is the risk of believing everything is “better” today because it can be done faster, or cheaper, or faster *and* cheaper than it was before.

&gt;While in Paris for the Spurs-Pacers series in January, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said that the European academy model for developing players, where players are part of a single organization for many years and brought along more slowly, was “preferable in many ways to the American system,” and that the maniacal desire by U.S. players to improve their individual skills and constantly play in the offseason leads to overuse injuries to players earlier in their careers.

&gt;**“It’s an exaggeration to say it, but often people shorthand it to say, in Europe, basketball elite players practice six days a week and play one, and in the United States they play six days a week and practice one,”** Silver told reporters. **“That’s not quite true. … (but) I think in youth basketball in the U.S., the young players are playing too many games, and I think that there’s sometimes too much of a focus on skill. It’s not that they’re not working as hard. Certainly, in some cases, I think they’re working too hard and need to be playing more sports at once.”**

&gt;The NBA game is better offensively than ever. But there are some Cro-Magnons who still believe stopping the other team has value, too. No one wants to go back to 86-84 finals games regularly. But it is not being “negative” to point out that it’s a lot easier to score now than 30 years ago. It isn’t being a “hater” to want to see big men — the subset of players who kept the NBA alive for generations, from George Mikan to Bob Pettit to Bill Russell, from Chamberlain to Willis Reed to Wes Unseld to Bill Walton, from Bob Lanier to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to Dave Cowens — not be played off the floor if their perceived value is solely limited to whether or not they can shoot behind the arc.

&gt;Slowly, there has been some moving back toward post play. The Rockets feed Alperin Şengün on the block. Jokić has won three league MVPs by displaying his prowess at the elbows much more than his ability to shoot deep — this season is the first in his career when he’s averaged even four 3-point attempts per game. But they’re still the exception rather than the rule.

&gt;More often than not, more NBA games than not look the same. Dozens of high pick-and-rolls, stepback 3s and corner 3s. Over and over and over and over.

&gt;The reason is simple: The corner 3 is the most efficient shot in basketball, and the shot that produces the most points per attempt. But even the best, the most prolific 3-point shooters miss a *lot* of 3s. And everyone isn’t as prolific as Curry or Thompson on the wings, or Jrue Holiday in the corners. Watching 3s clang off the rim, night after night … well, it isn’t edifying for everyone, put it that way.

&gt;There’s a reason the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference — the annual and now well-attended and well-funded get-together of the advanced stats sports community co-founded by 76ers general manager Daryl Morey — had a panel discussion this year titled, “Have the Nerds Ruined Basketball?” (Credit to them for being self-aware, at the least.)

&gt;But… 3 is still greater than 2.

&gt;**“The math is the math,”** Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “**I know, for us, we need to take a lot of 3s. Especially before we got Jimmy (Butler) — we never got to the free-throw line. So we had to take a lot of 3s.”**

&gt;Milwaukee coach Doc Rivers agreed that there’s a sameness in NBA play style — but only to a point.

&gt;**“I almost don’t want to say this, but (fans) absolutely can tell the difference between the good teams,”** Rivers said. **“You can’t tell the difference with some of the bad teams. And I’m being honest. A lot of the young teams that aren’t winning, they run down, take a lot of 3s, and that’s what they’re teaching. But they may have a bigger purpose later, if you know what I’m saying.**

&gt;**“But the good teams? You know exactly how they play — ball movement, attack, get to the free throw line, make 3s. Take the right shot. It’s an absolute difference when you watch. And you feel it in the games you play.”**

&gt;Indeed. The Celtics play much differently than, say, Oklahoma City. And OKC plays differently from, say, Cleveland. And Cleveland plays differently than Memphis. There is great variance between the elite teams, as should be expected; the best NBA teams are built around their superstars. And Jokić plays differently from Ja Morant, who plays differently from Anthony Edwards, who plays differently from Tatum, who plays differently from Jalen Brunson or Şengün. And their teams are wildly different in how they arrive at launching 3s.

&gt;Curry concurred with Rivers.

&gt;**“I think everybody looks at a stat sheet and you look at 3s taken, and compare that to the late 2010s, or early 2000s, and go ‘Yeah, that’s different,'”** Curry said. **“On the whole, OKC, Denver, L.A., Memphis, there’s definitely variance there. Teams know how to create advantages and use their talent appropriately. Like, watch us and the \[Redacted due to Sub Rules\], it’s totally different. It’s like us and Houston back in the day. It’s the exact same vibe.”**

&gt;The Thunder and Cavaliers, the two teams that have led their respective conferences most of this season, had a game for the ages on ESPN in January that was viewed as an opportunity to showcase the best of what the modern NBA can offer — two teams that move the ball, and bodies, and pass, and defend, all at elite levels, led by Gilgeous-Alexander and Cleveland’s Donovan Mitchell. The ratings for Cleveland’s 129-122 win showed the appetite for good basketball doesn’t depend on market size or Q-rating.

&gt;**“I don’t think we do a great job — we do a pretty good job, we’re doing a better job now — but I think we can do a better job of talking positively about what talent we have,”** Mitchell said. **“Look at the OKC versus us game. We’re starting to do that. When you highlight how talented this league truly is, the narrative shifts.”**

&gt;There is no doubt that sports media in general fail to convey how difficult it is for the elite in any sport — Shohei Ohtani pitching *and* hitting for the Dodgers, Patrick Mahomes throwing no-look passes 20 yards downfield for the Chiefs, Connor McDavid doing [this ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laNRPAjKQsM)a couple of years ago for the Edmonton Oilers — to do what they do, every night.

&gt;We make it seem like what Curry does is easy, if you just get up enough shots during practice.

&gt;It is not.

&gt;**“There’s something mesmerizing around … like, when I was watching \[Redacted due to Sub Rules\] and KD and Ant work out this summer (for the U.S. men’s Olympic team), it was totally different from the way I would approach it,”** Curry said. **“But you could see the fire in their eyes. Every moment I have out here matters. I call it, like, performance anxiety a little bit. I deal with that, too. If you don’t do this, if you don’t keep asking these questions, or reinvent yourself every year, you lose your edge. So there’s an extreme amount of respect of guys at 10 years, 12 years, 15 years, 20 years, that they keep doing it.”**

&gt;Yet, while a lot of people in today’s game love the current play style, it’s not for everyone.

&gt;**“Obviously, I’m kind of like the maverick of this league,”** two-time league MVP Antetokounmpo told *The Athletic.* **“My son’s name is Maverick. So, yeah, the way the league is played right now, it’s totally different from the way I play. A lot of 3s, a lot of early shots, early in the shot clock, fast offense, free flow, five-out offense. And it’s totally different now. Would I like to play the game the way the game was played when I got in the league, when it was like, a little bit more, the pace was slower?**

&gt;**“We tried to put the ball in the post. We had Greg Monroe; we tried to feed him the ball in the post. There was Al Jefferson in Charlotte, you had to get the ball in the post. You had Zaza Pachulia, and you just tried to play off of them.”**

&gt;Yet Antetokounmpo has found a way to be, at 30, as dominant as ever. If he isn’t a favorite for league MVP this season, he’s definitely in the top-five discussion. As such, while Milwaukee has nosedived down the stretch of the regular season, the Bucks still have at least a puncher’s chance in the playoffs — if they can, somehow, get Damian Lillard (deep vein thrombosis) back on the floor with him for the postseason.

&gt;Antetokounmpo is zigging while the rest of the league zags. He’s shooting his lowest amount of 3s since his second season in the league. Yet he remains one of the faces of the league; he doesn’t hurt at all for endorsements, and he continues to be viewed as one of the top 10 players in the game.

&gt;But, does Antetokounmpo feel he’s had to fight to keep playing the way he plays — a game not at all dependent on his ability to make 3s — throughout his career in Milwaukee?

&gt;**“No,”** he said. **“Because just me being efficient helps the team. Say if I was just shooting 2s, and I was shooting 2s at 35 percent from the field. They might say, ‘OK, we want to get more 3s (from you).’ When you’re shooting 58, 60 percent, you’ve got to keep doing that. At the end of the day, you’ve got to put the ball in the basket.”**

&gt;Yet the top teams in the league all play effective defense, without fouling, most every night. The top three teams in the league this season — Oklahoma City, Boston and Cleveland — rank first, fifth and eighth, respectively, in the league in Defensive Rating.

&gt;Yet, also, the NBA clearly instructed its referees to stop blowing their whistles so much the second half of last season, ending the parade of free throws and increasingly long games. Free throw shooting and scoring dropped significantly after the All-Star break. The game was allowed to be played more physically, which usually favors the defense. The trend has continued into this season.

&gt;**“Anything new is always going to take an adjustment period,”** four-time Hawks All-Star guard Trae Young told *The Athletic*. **“But I think a lot of people have been frustrated with the physicality of the game, things like that. I don’t think you can really complain about that this year, with the way that the refs are letting guys play and all those things. The game is continuing to resemble, a little bit, the old school, now, with the physicality.**

&gt;**“But you don’t always want the game to stay the same. As a player, you want the game to grow and get better than when you came in. That’s what I want as a player. I feel like that’s important for me, leaving the game better than what it was, and understanding that we’re not playing in the ’80s and ’90s, too. The game is always going to grow.”**

&gt;But Silver has acknowledged that his sport may have to look at additional rules changes to bring the game into better balance. It is a correct notion.

&gt;Baseball, of all the major U.S. team sports, has acted most decisively in recent years to make radical changes to its product to improve it.

&gt;Three years ago, the shift was killing the sport. Teams were taking advanced stats to their logical, absurd conclusion by putting multiple fielders on the right side of the infield to take away left-handed hitters’ prime areas for hits. Singles dropped to the lowest recorded levels in history. Batting averages plummeted. Stolen bases, one of the most exciting elements of the game, fell drastically. Yet games were still interminably long, at an average length of three hours, 10 minutes.

&gt;MLB did something about it in September 2022 when it announced three rule changes. It all but eliminated the shift. It made its bases slightly bigger, to make it easier for players to steal bases — to make it just a little easier for speed to stay in the game, rather than continuing to rely on the so-called “three true outcomes” to be the be-all and end-all. It limited pitchers to two “engagements,” or potential pickoff throws, with any base runner. Most importantly, it initiated a pitch clock, requiring pitchers to make their pitch within 15 seconds if there was no one on base, and within 20 seconds if there was someone on base. Steals have gone up dramatically in the last two years. And baseball times were reduced to two hours, 38 minutes last season.

&gt;Whatever the NBA comes up with is irrelevant to Durant. The basketball lifer just wants there to be a league in 30 years, long after he’s retired. He celebrates the game, with all its flaws.

&gt;**“It’s just good when basketball’s around,”** he said. **“Regardless of how it’s finishing, we should be grateful that we have such a beautiful sport to follow. Being around for this long, this game is never going to go nowhere, either. I’m just always big on enjoying the progression of the game, and quit all the complaining all the time about what could be better, and what we should be doing different, and all the nostalgia you get from the ’80s and ’90s.**

&gt;**“All right, I get it, but like, let’s just enjoy what we’ve got in front of us. It’s an important and incredible game. The game needs support from everybody if we want to keep going.”**",1004,681,2025-04-01,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jp65pn/aldrige_the_nba_is_as_talented_and_skilled_as_its/

nba,"[OC] The Story of John Y. Brown Jr, one of the worst owners of all-time and his insane lasting impact on the NBA","Originally, I set out to make this 100% about the Kentucky Colonels and how an owner (John Y. Brown Jr.) with more money than he could ever spend decided to be cheap and refused to pay 3 million dollars for the Kentucky Colonels to enter the NBA.

Instead, I got lost on the internet and found out that John Y. Brown Jr. honestly might be the most unknown major influence on the NBA, and one of the absolute worst owners of all time for two NBA franchises, and an ABA franchise. 

-------------------------------------------------

#**So who is John Y. Brown Jr.?**

* He was raised in Kentucky, and born to be a businessman. 

* One year in high school over summer break, he decided to sell vacuums. His father disapproved, so he set out to prove him wrong and made over $1,000 a month off selling vacuums, or roughly $9,500 per month when adjusted for inflation to 2020.

* In college at the University of Kentucky where he was studying to become a lawyer, he upgraded from vacuums to Encyclopædia Britannica box sets. Using his classmates as a ""sales crew"" (I'm like 90% sure this was a pyramid scheme), he made over $25,000 a year in college selling these Encyclopædia Britannica box sets. 

* $25,000 adjusted for inflation to 2020 is roughly... $228,000, and he was doing this all 4 years of college until he graduated as a lawyer in 1960.

* For the next 3 years he worked with his father's law practice, and was legal counsel for NFL Hall of Fame RB Paul Hornung in 1963 when he was suspended from the NFL for gambling on games. 

* In 1963 he met a man named Colonel Harland Sanders, and by 1964 had convinced Jack C. Massey to purchase KFC from Colonel Sanders for $2,000,000 (roughly $16,500,000 today). Everything you know about KFC today, from the red and white stripes to them being a fast-food company and not a sit down diner, is all because of John Y. Brown Jr convincing Jack C. Massey to buy KFC.

* In 1970, he was part of a group led by Wendell Cherry (co-founder of health insurance provider Humana) that bought ownership of the ABA Kentucky Colonels.

* A year later in 1971, John Y. Brown Jr. sold all his stock in KFC for $284,000,000, or a massive $1,792,910,435 when adjusted for today. 

-------------------------------------------

#**John Y. Brown Jr's First Official Impact on the ABA/NBA**

* Finally, we get to the 1972-73 ABA offseason, where we finally get into his connection to the ABA/NBA and the impacts he had.

* Following the 1972-73 season, Wendell Cherry, the majority owner, sold his shares to a group in Cincinnati that had the intention to move the team. 

* Upon hearing this news, John Y. Brown Jr immediately bought Cherry's sold shares from the group in Cincinnati, making sure that the Kentucky Colonels stayed in Kentucky. He was now the majority owner, and could make decisions on his own.

* He appointed his wife and 10 other women as the board of directors of the team. Kentucky Colonels GM Mike Storen believed this was a sign that John Y. Brown Jr intended to run the team ""his own way"", so he resigned. Ironically enough, 2 months later Mike Storen became the ABA league commissioner, and a few years later in 1977 became the GM and president of the Atlanta Hawks. 

* Kentucky Colonels head coach Joe Mullaney had similar feelings and resigned as well, saying ""Brown was going to be too meddlesome in personnel decisions.""

* The coach that replaced him, Babe McCarthy, only lasted a season under John Y. Brown Jr before resigning and dying only a few months later. 

---------------------------------------

#**This is Where the Shit gets Weird**

* At the beginning of the 1974-75 season, John Y. Brown Jr hired future Hall of Famer Hubie Brown, giving him his first ever professional head coaching job. 

* Hubie Brown helped lead the Kentucky Colonels to winning the ABA Championship in his 1st season, with a league best defense.

* The Kentucky Colonels, led by the dynamic trio of Dan Issel, Artis Gilmore, and Louie Dampier, went 58-26, and 13-3 in the playoffs on their way to a 4-1 championship win over the Indiana Pacers. 

* Even though the Colonels had won the ABA Championship and apparently had the 6th highest attendance that season in the ABA *and* NBA, John Y. Brown Jr claimed he lost hundreds of thousands of dollars that season. 

* Over the offseason leading into the 1975-76 season he sold hometown legend Dan Issel for $500,000, where he would spend the final 10 years of his career with the Denver Nuggets, averaging 20/8 for his NBA career. 

* Also over the offseason, John Y. Brown Jr convinces the ABA commissioner to challenge the NBA to a $1,000,000 winner-take-all championship series between the ABA Champ Kentucky Colonels, and the NBA Champ Rick Berry led Warriors. The NBA declines the challenge. 

* The 1975-76 Colonels go 46-38, beating the Indiana Pacers in the 1st round before eventually losing to the David Thompson and Dan Issel led Denver Nuggets. 

* Hubie Brown resigns following the season and becomes the Atlanta Hawks head coach in 1976. 

* John Y. Brown Jr and the Kentucky Colonels are given an offer to join the NBA for $3,000,000. Instead of accepting the offer though, he decides to fold the team for $3,000,000. With the Kentucky Colonels now considered folded, **this then leads to the Indiana Pacers being accepted into the NBA.**

* Following the Kentucky Colonels folding, their players are placed in a supplemental draft. The most notable player selected is Artis Gilmore, who's bought by the Chicago Bulls for $1,100,000. 

*This would seem like a seemingly obvious ending right? A man defeated by his own greed, folding a team that could've joined the NBA.*

**Fuck no, not for John Y. Brown Jr.** 

**Not even months later in 1976, John Y. Brown Jr purchases half-ownership in the Buffalo Braves, AKA the Clippers.**

--------------------------------

#**Buffalo Braves/San Diego/LA Clippers**

* Honestly, this is where shit *really* gets weird. John Y. Brown Jr truly shows how horrible he is at basketball while the owner of the Braves and how he was just in it for the money. 

* John Y. Brown Jr trades rookie of the year Adrian Dantley to the Indiana Pacers for Billy Knight.

* Four hours later, he trades George Johnson and a 1979 1st round pick to the New York Nets for Nate ""Tiny"" Archibald.

* Later during the 1976-77 season, he purchases the remaining 50% ownership of the Braves, and then resold that 50% to a man by the name of Harry T. Mangurian Jr.

* Before the team had been sold to John Y. Brown Jr, the previous owner of the Buffalo Braves had a handshake deal in place to sell the team for $6,100,000 to hotel owner Irving Cowan, who would then move the team to Miami. The city of Buffalo filed a $10,000,000 damage lawsuit against the team to block the move, which led to the sale eventually falling through. Because of this, the Braves would then sign a 15-year lease for the arena they played in, **with a provision that the lease would be voided if the team did not sell more than 5,000 season tickets in any given season.** 

* John Y. Brown Jr knew of this provision, and knew he could sell the team for a profit if the lease was voided. He intended to tank the Buffalo Braves to the point they were beyond awful, so that less than 5,000 season tickets would be sold and they'd be out of their lease on the arena.

* NBA legend and Hall of Famer Jack Ramsay, the head coach of the Buffalo Braves, caught wind of what John Y. Brown Jr intended to do and resigned, becoming the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, where they would go on to win the 1976-77 NBA Championship the following season.

* He trades Bob McAdoo to the New York Knicks for cash and John Gianelli, who was nothing more than a bench center that averaged 7/6 for his career. 

* He then traded a 1st round pick in the 1978 NBA draft and $232,000 in cash to the Blazers for Moses Malone (who had just selected him 5 months prior in the ABA supplemental draft, bad luck again for the Blazers).  

* 6 days later, John Y. Brown Jr trades Moses Malone to the Houston Rockets for 1977 and 1978 1st round picks. 

* In 1978 along with co-owner Harry T. Mangurian Jr, they **trade franchises** with Celtics owner Irv Levin. Irv Levin would then eventually move the Buffalo Braves to San Diego, where they would be rebranded as the San Diego Clippers. 

* This gave John Y. Brown Jr and Harry T. Mangurian Jr total ownership of the Boston Celtics. 

-------------------------------

#**John Y. Brown Jr's Ridiculously Short Celtics Career**

* Two weeks before the franchise swap was made official,  John Y. Brown Jr made one final trade as the owner and GM of the Buffalo Braves. 

* He traded Nate ""Tiny"" Archibald, Billy Knight, and Marvin Barnes *to the Celtics* for Freeman Williams, Kevin Kunnert, and Kermit Washington **without consulting or even talking to team president and legendary coach Red Auerbach.** 

* Not wanting to strain the relationship any further with Celtics legend Red Auerbach, John Y. Brown Jr then trades three future 1st round picks (all in 1979) for Bob McAdoo, once again without consulting or even talking to Red Auerbach. Bob McAdoo would play only 20 games with the Celtics. 

* The relationship between John Y. Brown Jr and Red Auerbach was so bad that Red Auerbach nearly took a job with the Knicks.

* Shortly afterwards, Harry T. Mangurian Jr bought out John Y. Brown Jr's ownership shares, and in 1979, Harry T. Mangurian Jr officially became the sole owner of the Boston Celtics. Under his ownership, the Celtics would win the 1980-811 NBA Championship, before eventually being forced to sell the team in 1983.

--------------------------------------

And with that, John Y. Brown Jr. was done with his involvement in the NBA. A few months later in 1979 he ran and became Governor of Kentucky, promising to run the state like a business.


------------------------

#**In Summary...**

**Kentucky Colonels**

* Sold the hometown star (Dan Issel) for $500,000 to the Denver Nuggets, causing fans to refund and refuse to buy season tickets

* Complained that he was losing hundreds of thousands of dollars (I wonder why...)

* Sold the team instead of paying $3,000,000 to join the NBA

**Buffalo Braves**

* Bought the Buffalo Braves months after folding the Colonels and complaining about losing money.

* Actively tried to force fans to not buy season tickets so that he could sell the team easier. 

* Traded Adrian Dantley and Bob McAdoo, traded *for* Moses Malone and then traded him 6 days later, and ran off legendary coach Jack Ramsay.

* Traded franchises with the Celtics owner, which eventually led to the Braves moving to San Diego and then LA as the Clippers, and not moving to Miami. 

* Two weeks before officially owning the Celtics, as his last act as the Owner/GM of the Braves, he traded Nate ""Tiny"" Archibald, Billy Knight, and Marvin Barnes *to the Celtics* for Freeman Williams, Kevin Kunnert, and Kermit Washington.

**Boston Celtics**

* Refused to talk or even consult with legendary Celtics coach and current team president Red Auerbach on two major team-altering trades, nearly sending Red Auerbach to take a job with the Knicks out of frustration. 

* Traded three 1st round picks in 1979 for Bob McAdoo, who would only play 20 games for the Celtics. 

* Had such an awful relationship with Red Auerbach that he nearly took a job with the Knicks. 

* Was such a disaster that not even a year into owning the Celtics, his partner bought out his ownership shares.

**Portland Trail Blazers**

* Drove NBA legend head coach Jack Ramsey out of Buffalo and to Portland, where he would win the NBA championship the following year. 

**Indiana Pacers**

* Led to the Pacers joining the NBA after the Colonels folded.",954,107,2020-06-23,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/heeby3/oc_the_story_of_john_y_brown_jr_one_of_the_worst/

**Current Era Recap**

*The Mavericks are a franchise that has been spoiled by success over the course of the recent decade. The franchise was founded in 1980 by Don Carter. The Mavericks three eras can be most aptly defined as follows: a period of semi-relevance and dark-horse playoff contention from 1983-1990 (the highlight of which was Dallas taking the ""Showtime"" Lakers to seven games in the Western Conference Finals in the 1987-88 season), a miserable period of irrelevance from 1990-2000 in which the team failed to make the playoffs even once (reaching an historic low point in 1992 under Richie Adubato in which they opened the season 2-27), and finally; the Mark Cuban/Dirk Nowitzki era (from 2000 until today). During this recent stretch, the Mavericks have qualified for the playoffs in every season but one (which was last year). The three head coaches during this time period were Don Nelson (no defense), Avery Johnson (too much defense), and Rick Carlisle (just right).*

**2012-2013 Season Recap**

[2012-2013 Starting Lineup - skip to 2:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcChDBNKSAo)

* This was a particularly painful season for Mavs fans for a couple of reasons; chief among them being injuries to crucial players. By now everyone is probably familiar with the knee issues Dirk had last year to start the season (he missed the first 27 games due to arthroscopic surgery and recovery).

* As always, with an injury of that nature and a player of Dirk's age - even a typically healthy one, he is an iron man as far as veterans are concerned - there is a lengthy reincorporation process for the player to get acclimated to playing at game speed and being in game shape.

* This problem was exacerbated by the fact that Dirk was surrounded by an entirely new group of players and playstyles that he was forced to adjust to on the fly. Dirk is one of the smartest and most savvy players in the league, and surprisingly he was able to make it work to a significant extent (the Mavericks finished the season 28-18; beating the Nuggets, Bulls, Clippers, Hawks, Rockets(2x), Nets, Warriors and Grizzlies during the aforementioned span).

* Marion also missed 15 games including a brutal stretch of eight games down the home stretch in mid-March when we were still clawing for that 8th seed.

* Of course, the second reason the season was painful was that we didn't make the playoffs, as is evident at the top of the post. Last season marked the first time since 2000 that we had missed out on the postseason - and while we consoled ourselves with the fact that our team was able to remain so competitive despite being so utterly devoid of talent and cohesion, it was of little comfort to a franchise accustomed to success.

* Although Dirk has labored (and triumphed, mind you) with supporting casts that are downright laughable in comparison to the murderer's row trotted out by the likes of Miami (and the Clippers/Nets it seems this year), last year's squad was particularly pathetic. Because the Mavs were trying to save up cap space for a marquee free agent like Dwight Howard (oops...), and the front office was unwilling to pay nine figures in luxury taxes (unlike Brooklyn), the team was almost entirely composed of players signed to 1-year deals (Collison, Brand, Kaman) or 2-year deals with player options for the second year (Mayo).

**Playoffs**

Ah, but alas, a new day is upon us! Let us set gaze to brighter future, and see glory brought to this house once again. ~~Batiatus!~~ Let's go Mavs!

**2013-2014**

There's been a TON of activity on this front for the Mavericks - it's been a busy offseason to say the least. But let's start with the draft.

Dallas had the 13th pick in this year's NBA Draft.  They pulled off a trade with the Celtics to move down to 16 and then a subsequent trade with the Hawks to move down to 18. They also acquired Milwaukee’s 43rd pick via trade with Atlanta. Here’s who they got.

Shane Larkin | PG | University of Miami
|:--- | :---: | :---: |

Larkin was the Co-ACC Conference Player of the Year. He also won the Lute Olson Award in addition to being an AP Second Team All-American. Unfortunately, he messed up (read: broke) his ankle during summer ball and will be sidelined for another 8 weeks or so.

Chad Ford's Take: *The Mavs were looking for a point guard with Darren Collison heading into free agency. Larkin is small, but he's an elite athlete, plays the pick-and-roll very well and can really shoot the ball. If he were a little bigger or longer, he would've gone much higher. He's a solid pick here for the Mavs.*

The second pick of the draft for the Mavs was:

Ricky Ledo | SG | Providence
|:--- | :---: | :---: |

Ledo was initially taken by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 43rd pick. This pick was traded to the Hawks, who then traded the pick to the Mavericks in return for Brooklyn's 2014 second-rounder (which Dallas acquired from Boston earlier in the draft) and the rights to Mike Muscala out of Bucknell (whom Dallas drafted on behalf of Atlanta). His biggest knock is that he's had some significant character issues.

Chad Ford's Take: *Ledo has top-10 talent. He's a scoring machine who can really shoot the ball. He slipped after missing the season because the NCAA declared him academically ineligible in addition to numerous off-court issues. If the [Mavs] can rehabilitate him, he has a chance to be this year's Lance Stephenson.*

In the past, the Mavericks have typically sold draft picks at fire sale rates in order to lubricate transactions for veteran role players. But it seems like the front office's approach to the draft is evolving under the specter of the new collective bargaining agreement. I'm really excited about Ledo. He's a 6-6, 200 pound pure athlete who can score at will. If Carlisle can get him to apply himself and buy into the system he would be an absolute theft of a selection.

Now let's get into the free agent market! (Part 2 in comments, ~~Part 3 in comments~~ Part 3 posted here!)

**EDIT 5:** /u/tornado_watch reminded me of a great post by Mark Cuban about the direction and soul of our team, I have included it [here.](http://blogmaverick.com/2013/08/03/lets-talk-mavs-mffl/)",754,207,2013-08-05,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jraj4/20132014_30_teams_in_30_days_dallas_mavericks/
nba,9 Native players in NBA history,"There may be others, but these are the only 9 Native players in NBA history that I'm aware of right now. 

**Bob Harrison:** Harrison was the primary SG during the Lakers' early run of titles with George Mikan ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/harribo02.html)). He was a 1x All-Star and a 3x champion, but he's most famous for hitting a [half-court bomb of a buzzer beater](https://youtu.be/X9feuTd3XJk) to win Game 1 of the 1950 Finals. [Here](https://harrisonhis.wordpress.com/2011/11/24/harrisons-heritage-an-nba-rarity/) is an article about his Native heritage (*I believe he was Hočąk*), including this info about how open his heritage was during his playing days: *""While with the Lakers, Harrison served as president of the Minnesota-based North American Indian Society in 1951-52. Also during his time in Minneapolis, on a night when Harrison was honored by his team, a number of local tribes presented him with a deerskin jacket.""* He mentioned in the link that he tanned dark ([#16](https://www.nba.com/timberwolves/sites/timberwolves/files/gettyimages-1380127.jpg)) and once when he was in the Marines he was made to sit in the back of the train because they thought he was black.

**Phil Jordon:** Jordon was of Wailaki and Nomlaki descent, and was a decent center around 1960 ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordoph01.html)). His biggest claim to fame was probably that he did NOT play in the game where Wilt scored 100 points. Jordon was the Knicks' starting center in '62 --and their only starter taller than 6-ft-6-- but he drank an entire case of beer the night before the game and sat out ""sick"", so the already awful Knicks who had a horrible front court had no chance against the Warriors and Wilt who had a historic day on the way to a blow-out victory. 

**Gary Gray:** Gray was part of the Delaware Nation while growing up in Oklahoma. He played sparingly for the Royals during the '68 season ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/grayga01.html)), was then selected by the Bucks in the 1968 Expansion Draft, but he never played beyond that 1 season in Cincinnati. 

**Sonny Dove:** Dove's mother was Mashpee Wampanoag and after he had a fantastic college career at St. John's, he was the #4 pick in the 1967 draft by the Pistons (*1 pick before Walt Frazier*). He played sparingly with Detroit for 2 years, then he went to the ABA's Nets for 3 seasons ('70-72), averaging 14 ppg and 8 rpg during his first 2 seasons in NY ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/doveso01.html)). His career ended early due to a bicycle accident, and he went on to earn his degree and announce St. John's games until his death in 1983.

**John Starks:** In this article about Ron Baker ([link](https://www.potawatomi.org/blog/2017/12/05/drive-day-sports-resume-built-leading-high-school-college-championship-games-new-york-knick-ron-baker-also-credits-native-heritage-success/)), Starks is referred to as ""Oklahoma born-and-raised Muscogee (Creek) Nation athlete John Starks"". He had an insane backstory that lead to his NBA career (*4 different colleges, spent a couple years in 2 leagues that both collapsed, and the Knicks were forced to keep him in '90 when he got injured during a pre-season practice while attempting a dunk on Ewing*) who went on to be a beloved Knick who played with fiery passion and shot a ton of 3's. He was named an All Star in '94 when NY went to the Finals, was All-D in '93, and the '97 6th Man of the Year ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/starkjo01.html)). 

**Bison Dele:** According to Wikipedia, ""he was of African-American and Cherokee descent."" He was a decent rebounder and finisher near the hoop ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/delebi01.html)), but he's most well known as a player for winning a ring with the '97 Bulls. He had an extremely interesting personal life, playing multiple instruments, being an avid adventure traveler, flying planes, and dating Madonna, but his biggest headlines were made for his bizarre disappearance and presumed murder at sea in 2002.

**Cherokee Parks:** He was named after the Cherokee tribe of his great grandmother. As a player, he is most well known for his college days at Duke where he backed up Christian Laettner during the '92 championship season, the year of the famous [Duke-UK game](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/1992-03-28-duke.html). As a pro, he played for 7 franchises in 9 seasons ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/parksch02.html)).

**Ron Baker:** Baker is a Citizen Potawatomi Nation tribal member and Navarre family descendent who attended Wichita State on a Potawatomi scholarship, then played on the Shockers as a walk-on before honing his shooting to become a key player on their unexpected run to the 2013 Final Four. He played for 3 seasons in the NBA ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bakerro01.html)) after going undrafted.

**Kyrie Irving:** Irving is well known to modern NBA fans (*7x All Star, '12 ROTY, '14 ASG MVP, '16 champion - [career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/irvinky01.html)*). His mother was a Standing Rock Sioux and lived on a reservation before being adopted at a young age. She later died when Kyrie was 4 so he didn't have much of a connection to this part of his heritage for most of his life, but Kyrie and his sister Asia both joined the tribe at a naming ceremony in 2018.",749,99,2021-11-25,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/r1xv25/9_native_players_in_nba_history/

1	|	[](/MIL) Bucks	|	--	|	40-6	|	The Bucks are very quietly on an 8 game win streak, but hey that sort of thing happens when you're 40-6. Donte DiVincenzo continues to look like a future star despite his lack of box score stats. Khris has continuted to be incredible in his role, being arguably a top 3 ""second-fiddle"" this season. And the whole team got to pretty much hang out in Paris all week. It's a good time to be a Bucks fan. [RIP Kobe](https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1218%2Fr303897_1296x729_16-9.jpg)	|
2	|	[](/LAL) Lakers	|	--	|	36-10	|	Simply put, without Kobe I wouldn’t be into basketball. My earliest basketball memories involve me at 7 years old begging my dad to stay up to watch the Kobe/Shaq Lakers, particularly the 2000 finals and the game 4 where Shaq fouled out and Kobe closed the game out in overtime. Kobe ignited a passion in basketball for me that has burned for nearly 20 years at this point. Hell, I got into reddit by arguing with proto-nephews on /r/nba about Kobe when I was a freshman in college, a college that I chose in part because of its basketball program, a decision I wouldn’t have made without Kobe getting me into the sport. As with all of you, my final memory of Kobe on the basketball court was his closeout 60 point game, and it left me inspired that no matter what obstacles are in one’s way, no matter how many roadblocks one had to overcome, one can persevere and finish what they started on one’s own terms. This tragedy is just unfathomable and my heart goes out to of course the Bryant family for the loss of Kobe and GiGi, but also the Altobellis, the Chesters, and the Zobayans.	|
3	|	[](/UTA) Jazz	|	--	|	32-13	|	Just in case you missed it, Rudy Gobert had [another amazing block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxMlx7MBJlw) in the clutch against Dallas on Saturday, giving the Jazz another win in their hot start of the 2020 calender year. A tougher test for Utah's roster is right around the corner with an upcoming barrage of Western Conference contending teams on the schedule docket before All Star Weekend hits in February, hopefully with Gobert and Mitchell attending. On another note, a [few highlighted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPSD6PerduQ) [memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y64OsZNYhp0) on the [career of Kobe Bryant.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMtli7Z9MDw) 	|
4	|	[](/LAC) Clippers	|	+1	|	33-14	|	Obviously Kobe had such an impact on LA sports, and honestly made it harder for the Clippers to make a name for themselves in the early 2000s. Luckily his insane skill and Dan Gilbert's saltiness led to Chris Paul being sent to LAC. Lob city was the begining of a real identity for the Clippers. Which led to [this moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrXZ3kFrB0I). Currently though, the Clippers are playing pretty well, and once PG comes back I'm sure they'll play better than ever.	|
5	|	[](/TOR) Raptors	|	+4	|	32-14	|	Following a 7-0 stretch these past two weeks, the raptors have moved their way into the 2nd seed in the east. With a favourable schedule remaining, and continued domination of teams below .500, the outlook on the remainder of this season is extremely promising. However none of the raptors domination as of late could ever compare to the dominating 81 point performance Kobe Bryant once put up against the raptors in what will forever go down as the greatest and most memorable loss in raptors franchise history. That game was truly a testament to his relentlessness and desire to win above all else. May both he and Gianna Rest In Peace.	|
6	|	[](/DEN) Nuggets	|	+1	|	32-14	|	The year was 2009. The Nuggets were riding high as they entered the Western Conference Finals to face off against the powerhouse Los Angeles Lakers, who were on a mission themselves to avenge their loss in the finals to Boston the previous year. While the Lakers won the hard fought series in 6 games enroute to the first of their back-to-back championships, the main entertainment during the series was the legendary duels between the two stars on the court, Carmelo Anthony and Kobe Bryant. [Game 1 was perhaps the best of the series, as Melo finished with 39 points and 6 rebounds, while Kobe managed to top him with 40 points and 6 rebounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDdiSCt1zVU) enroute to a 105-103 Lakers victory. This was one of many memories of Kobe's dominance that left me infuriated and awestruck as a Nuggets fan. Rest easy, Mamba. Your legacy will live on forever.	|
7	|	[](/MIA) Heat	|	+1	|	31-14	|	""Every man has two deaths, when he is buried in the ground and the last time someone says his name. In some ways men can be immortal."" - Ernest Hemingway// Shouting Kobe's name whenever you shot the ball was always like a prayer to guide the shot on its journey. Kobe will be  a man that could create magic out of the unlikeliest places www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8Tk_AK45eA.  RIP Kobe, Gianna, and the rest of the passengers onboard who were taken from their families and loved ones way too early.           Dion Waiters finally made his appearance and it went better than anyone expected. January has gone just like how I hoped although some of the losses (like to the Nets and Knicks) bother me. We've had trouble in the later parts of the game for the past few weeks where we'd make it unnecessarily close and dance with a loss. Hopefully, as the playoffs get closer we get better at closing the door when ahead.  	|
8	|	[](/BOS) Celtics	|	-4	|	30-15	|	Since the last powerrankings, the Celtics are 4-4 with victories over Bulls, Lakers, Grizzlies, and Magic, and losses to the Pelicans, Pistons, Bucks, and Suns. It's an extremely hard stretch of games and it'll continue to be so for about another month, with the Celtics playing 7 games over the next 2 weeks with matchups against the Heat (2nd night of a back-to-back), Warriors, 76ers, Hawks, Magic, Hawks again, and then the Thunder. And of course with the awful news yesterday regarding Kobe's tragic passing, [let's remember his final game in Boston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0shp8g5cVyU).	|
9	|	[](/PHI) 76ers	|	+2	|	30-17	|		|
10	|	[](/DAL) Mavericks	|	--	|	28-17	|	Dallas was finally healthy again, but just minutes into that, Dwight Powell went down with an Achilles rupture. He was an advanced stats favorite and did the dirty work on the floor, so his presence will be missed. Mavs also acquired Willie Cauley-Stein in the meantime. More importantly, I'd like to move on to tell my favorite Kobe memory. It has to be the Matt Barnes incident with the ball fake. I watched that game live, and as most of you that have interacted with me know, I'm a big Magic fan along with Mavs since I'm from Orlando originally. When he didn't even flinch, that's when I knew all of the ""Mamba Mentality"" stuff was real. The other memory I have of Kobe was the realization in 2006 of how great he was. I remember sitting in a Chili's with my parents and seeing the TV talking about how he was carrying the team. I was 12 at the time, and I wasn't exactly great at breaking down what I had seen, so I relied on ESPN. I had hated Kobe for the prior 6 years, but that was a turning point for me. From there, I really became interested in keeping up with basketball more- I committed to watching more Mavs games since I didn't have league pass, and I made damn sure to tune in when Kobe was on. May Kobe rest in peace. I wish he could know how many people he impacted, even in the slightest regard. He changed the NBA for the better.	|
11	|	[](/IND) Pacers	|	+1	|	30-17	|	Despite tough losses to both Utah and Portland, the Pacers concluded a 5-game road trip with a 3-2 record. The Pacers played without Malcolm Brogdon and Myles Turner at various points of the trip, and still managed to hit the 30-win mark on the road. T.J. Warren in particular had a very nice road trip,  averaging over 20 points per game at nearly 60% from the field. Indiana gets a nice 2-day break to recuperate before the day everyone has been waiting for: Wednesday, January 29. The return of Victor Oladipo.	|
12	|	[](/HOU) Rockets	|	-6	|	28-17	|	The story of the past couple weeks has been the downfall of Harden and the rise of Westbrook. The results haven't been going our way for this recent stretch, but anything we have salvaged can be attributed to Westbrook stepping up big time.  But us fans have confidence that Harden has a good head on his shoulders and he'll get back to his ways soon enough. Kobe did, too. He once told Tyson Chandler after a pickup game with a young James Harden in 2011, ""he's going to be the next one after me.""	|
13	|	[](/OKC) Thunder	|	--	|	28-19	|	Oklahoma City's memories of Kobe Bryant are a story of succession, of the passing of a baton, of firsts and lasts. In April of 2010, an overachieving young Thunder team walked into Los Angeles to face Bryant's juggernaut 1-seed Lakers in OKC's first ever playoff series. The result was an electrifying duel between Bryant and the rising stars Durant and Westbrook, both 10 years his junior. Though the heavily favored Lakers triumphed on the court 4-2, the series proved to be a victory of sorts for all sides. With Westbrook embodying Bryant's fierce, ruthless competitiveness and Durant embodying his killer instinct as a stone-cold closer, Bryant's legacy shaped the future of basketball in Oklahoma City like few others.	|
14	|	[](/MEM) Grizzlies	|	--	|	22-24	|	Don’t let the return of Zion, and ESPN’s shattering orgasm at his return, distract you from the fact that Ja Morant is still the clear-cut Rookie of the Year. Also… I think we are a playoff team? We didn’t rebuild so much as reload. Outside the main guys, Clarke looks to have been an absolute steal and Brooks deserves more credit than he gets. Also, not Grizz related, but rest in peace Kobe.	|
15	|	[](/SAS) Spurs	|	+2	|	20-25	|		|
16	|	[](/ORL) Magic	|	-1	|	21-26	|	The past couple months have not gone great for the Magic. Games generally start off well, but those stretches late in the first half and early second half always seem to follow a pattern. Lose the lead or a deficit gets even bigger. Hard to see this roster getting anywhere with its current build. Maybe WeltHam are gonna need to make another big splash at the deadline. On a more real note, Kobe was an all-time great and who could ever forget him [staring down Matt Barnes](https://youtu.be/aYLR4BcX7Rg?t=142) like it was nothing?	|
17	|	[](/POR) Trail Blazers	|	+2	|	20-27	|	Damian Lillard's first career game was against Kobe. The Bean scored 47 that night, but had high praise for the Blazer guard. In the last week of Kobe's life, Lillard channeled his inner Kobe, going off for 47 himself, 61, and 50 in three consecutive games. His supperb play hasn't translaetd to a ton of wins, but that's hardly his fault. He's doing everything he can to keep the ship afloat. RIP Kobe. 	|
18	|	[](/NOP) Pelicans	|	+4	|	18-29	|	Kobe had a lot of great moments against this team. One of his most mythical stories was [when he hurt his shooting shoulder, so he finished the game playing left handed](https://youtu.be/NuXfJJR0eFk). He made [big plays](https://youtu.be/4mxiTQgX71o). He had [great comebacks](https://youtu.be/c0yJVX74rC0). But what I'll always remember the most was when [Kobe came into town during his farewell tour and dominated us on national television for a win against a desperate Pels squad](https://youtu.be/c0yJVX74rC0). Rest in Paradise Bean. 	|
19	|	[](/PHX) Suns	|	-1	|	19-27	|	Kobe Bryant was an incredible basketball player who tormented and dominated the Phoenix Suns for years. As good as he was as a player, from am outsider's perspective he seemed to be an even better father to his four daughters. The same way he helped so many discover their passion of hoops, he inspired parents to be better for their kids. Rest in peace Kobe, Gianna, John, Keri, Alyssa, Christina, and the unnamed others.	|
20	|	[](/BKN) Nets	|	-4	|	19-26	|	It's been a tough stretch for the Nets. Even with Kyrie back, the team is struggling with injuries and poor play. But, with the recent passing of Kobe, I don't feel like writing much about the Nets. Kobe was a pillar of the NBA and for most of us on this subreddit, he was around for the entirity of our exposure to the sport. I was only a little 6 year old kid when Kobe and Shaq decimated my New Jersey Nets and I was given an early understanding that Kobe was one tough motherf*cker. His continued impact on the sport led me to become a huge fan of him as a person, leader, and representative of the sport. He taught so many of us that perserverance and drive could lead you to anything you put your mind to. His legend grew to a myth as time went on and stories began to leak of his unparalled work ethic. I look forward to teaching my kids about the life and story of Kobe Bryant.	|
22	|	[](/CHI) Bulls	|	+2	|	18-30	|	Ya like guards? Watch the Bulls. With WCJ, Lauri, and rookie Daniel Gafford all sustaining multi-week injuries, the Bulls are running 3-PG lineups most of the time now. We've been alternating wins and losses for the past few weeks thanks to who? You guessed it- Zach LaVine, who is averaging 30 points per game in the year 2020 and finished 6th in East backcourt All-Star voting. GarPax and Boylen continue to mismanage this team, and if things continue at the current pace then the Bulls may just wind up finishing the season in the dreaded 9th seed. /// Being in different conferences, Kobe Bryant and the Bulls didn't match up too often, but that didn't stop the Black Mamba from always being memorable to us. At age 19, Kobe dropped 33 in the United Center. MJ asked Coach Jackson to keep him in despite the Bulls' 4th-quarter lead just so he could continue to match up against Kobe. Can't get any more legendary than that. Thank you Kobe. #RIP	|
22	|	[](/DET) Pistons	|	+3	|	17-30	|	The Pistons suck. Reggie Jackson is back and looks healthy which is fun but also mostly meaningless. The team appears to be in a sort of limbo until the deadline. Everyone knows that several players are likely on their way out, and it is hanging over the whole team. Regardless of who all leaves, everyone is ready for the deadline to pass so we can just know what the team will look like the rest of the season.	|

24	|	[](/WAS) Wizards	|	+2	|	15-30	|	My original favorite player, Kobe Bryant was a huge part of my childhood and was one of the primary reasons that I fell in love with basketball. The first NBA game that I ever attended was between the Wizards and the Lakers, and I remember cheering just as loudly when Kobe scored as when the Wiz did. My personal favorite Kobe moment was his epic offensive duel with Gilbert Arenas in 2007 (For those interested, here's a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFqsCucNY0) ). It was truly incredible watching Kobe and Arenas score back and forth, each one going at each other up and down the court. They ended up combining for 105 points, and I remember going to school the next morning trying to impersonate them during recess at school. I saw a rerun of it on NBA Hardwood Classics last year and found myself being just as awestruck then as I was as a kid. Rest in peace Kobe, Gianna, and the others killed in the horrific crash. The game will miss you and remember you forever. As for today's Wizards...um...we're 15 games under .500 but still only 4 games out of the playoffs!	|
25	|	[](/CHA) Hornets	|	-2	|	15-31	|	The Hornets are on an eight-game losing streak. That doesn’t seem important right now. Charlotte drafted Kobe Bryant 13th overall in 1996 and traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers. The Kobe-against-my-team moment I remember most was [his game winner](https://youtu.be/fcl1Tv90OaM?t=622) against the Bobcats on March 12, 2005, in the old Charlotte Coliseum. I was ten years old, and I cried that night. I lamented that basketball was so unfair, and that Kobe was just too good. I cried last night too, fifteen years later. I lamented that life was so unfair, and that Kobe was just too young. Rest In Peace, Mamba - there will never be another competitor like you.	|

GoNets,I have a cool story about Spencer Dinwiddie that I haven't shared before!,"What up y'all. Outside of Spencer, I can't claim to be a Nets fan at all. Raised in Colorado and always rooted for my Buffs and Nuggets... anyway. I have a neat little story about the type of dude Spencer is that I thought you guys may appreciate.  
  
As a kid in high school I was quite the loner, but the one thing that I always found friends through was basketball. Going to CU games and watching Spencer was my favorite thing, and I have fond memories of sprinting through snow in shorts and a t-shirt from the free parking ~2 miles away up to Coors Event Center with my friends.  
  
From the day he committed and I saw his highlights and interviews, he was my favorite player. I think he plays smarter, and has better basketball IQ, than any other PG out there - to me the best basketball to watch is clean and calculated. At this time, being the weird, out-of-place kid I was, I also friended all the CU basketball and football players on Facebook. Dunno why, just thought it was cool at the time.  
  
For Christmas my sophomore year, all I really wanted was a #25 CU jersey. My parents told me they looked everywhere but couldn't find one. In my desperation, I turned directly to Spencer for help. Here was the convo: https://i.imgur.com/mIcxfCH.png  
  
Years go by and, sure enough, as I boldly predicted (he was a college soph. at the time of original message, and would go on to miss half his junior year with a torn ACL), Spencer winds up in the NBA. First bouncing around with the Pistons as you guys know after yesterday, then the Bulls, finally sticking with the Nets. One day I found the old convo and decided to shoot it his way on Instagram: https://imgur.com/a/I3Umk8a  
  
And The Mayor fucking pulled through! He sent a Nets jersey out, and it arrived just in time for Christmas of last year, 5 Christmases after I was unable to get the jersey of his I had longed for. I was giddy, had no idea how to thank him, but it absolutely made my holiday. His jersey (and signature) are now proudly displayed on the wall of my apartment, and I have such a cool backstory to share with them! https://imgur.com/a/YnWAl0o  
  
**Tl;dr young, stupid highschool me couldn't get my hands on Spencer's jersey when he played at CU, he said he'd get me one once in the NBA someday, and made good on that promise 5 full years later.**",696,49,2018-11-02,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/9tf8nq/i_have_a_cool_story_about_spencer_dinwiddie_that/

GoNets,I'm incredibly depressed (re-Kyrie and team generally),"Long-time Nets fan since the J-Kidd days (and a Jewish American). Man, I don't even know what to do about everything going on with the team -- and everything since Irving got here.

I was at the game last night and anxious to go with all of the garbage he was tweeting out. And then to watch the team play with such little energy (with the exception of my guys Joey Buckets). It's just utterly disheartening.

Even worse is seeing some folks (not here) spinning some of his words as fine and defending it. I'm definitely not saying NBA players have to always be perfect but Kyrie's constant doubling down of conspiracy nonsense has not only hurt the fanbase (I have multiple friends who won't go a Nets game until he's gone) but also has hurt the team itself.

Wondering how long this can all go on for. I truly long for the days of not only Kenny and the younger team, but J-Kidd. Just a team to be proud of instead of this mess. Even Cam and the other rookies are leaving me sour.

Just a feeling of blow it all up and start over - it feels way too far gone. And to me the key link of a lot of it has been Kyrie.",521,276,2022-10-30,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/yhcspk/im_incredibly_depressed_rekyrie_and_team_generally/

nba,"[Goodwill] It’s no coincidence the 2 franchises Durant has eyed represent some kind of stability and competitive consistency. Sources told Yahoo Sports wanting to play alongside Devin Booker is a main motivation, along with the possibility of being slated next to Miami’s Jimmy Butler","[Source](https://sports.yahoo.com/kevin-durants-trade-request-doesnt-absolve-him-of-blame-for-the-biggest-failure-in-nba-history-044404205.html)

&gt;The Nets had to say yes to Durant and Irving, they’d be fools not to. They had no identity on the NBA’s cultural map, in the shadow of the back-page grabbing Knicks. But it appears they didn’t set actual parameters, as if they were so grateful to be graced by today’s stars they didn’t bother to have a level of structure to be followed, let alone respected.

&gt;It’s no coincidence the two franchises Durant has eyed represent some kind of stability and competitive consistency, with the Phoenix Suns and Miami Heat being atop his list. For all the influence Durant perhaps craved and was granted in Brooklyn, he’s a hooper first and second — with the game being the main thing with #HeatCulture and in the Suns’ building.

&gt;Sources told Yahoo Sports wanting to play alongside Devin Booker is a main motivation, along with the possibility of being slated next to Miami’s resident hard-ass Jimmy Butler — two players whose attendance is rarely questioned.

-

&gt; Who does Durant feel like he can trust? Perhaps it’s Irving, but even that has to be shaken at this point. It’s impossible to interpret his state of mind, but if it’s possible to give him credit, he knew when it was time to leave.

&gt;Pat Riley and Erik Spoelstra, the unwavering duo capable of handling everything from LeBron James and Dwyane Wade to Butler and everyone in between, looks like a beacon next to the clown show in Brooklyn. Monty Williams is the adult in Phoenix, perhaps overshadowing the controversy at levels higher than himself, with a great relationship with Durant — while also not being afraid to coach him.",438,383,2022-07-01,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/voshus/goodwill_its_no_coincidence_the_2_franchises/
nba,21 Great Tim Duncan Moments [OC],"After getting their 21st win of the season against the Phoenix Suns, the San Antonio Spurs are going to hang up number 21 in the rafters tonight. After 19 years with the Spurs, there are plenty of great moments that Tim Duncan has provided fans for the past two decades, and to celebrate his jersey retirement, here are 21 of my favorite moments of the future Hall-Of-Famer.

**1.	Tim’s First-Ever Playoff Game**

[32 points and 10 rebounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB7XD8km7L0) in his first ever playoff game at the age of 21 during his rookie season. Some notable players with similar stat lines in their rookie year, first playoff appearance, or first playoff game include:

Alonzo Mourning: *30 points and 11 rebounds* in his first playoff game as a rookie against Boston in 93’. Age: 23.

Hakeem Olajuwon: Dropped a cool *32 points and 14 rebounds* in his fifth playoff game of his rookie year. Age: 22.

Lebron James: Although he didn’t manage to get into the playoffs until his 3rd year, Lebron got a triple double with *32 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists* in his first playoff game against the Wizards. Age: 21.

Tim Duncan sits with some very elite company to drop those wild numbers at such a young age. 

**2.	His First Championship**

In the 1999 season, sophomore Tim Duncan went up against the Knicks in the finals. Yes, you read that right, the *New York Knicks* in the finals. Tim's first ring will likely have some sentiment, but it means more to the people around him, especially David Robinson and Gregg Popovich. Sure, Robinson was an established all-star, but up until that point in his career, he had never tasted the finals. Popovich also won 56 games in the previous season, but who knows where he would be if he didn’t get a ring that year. In a 4-1 series victory, Tim killed the Knicks in game 5 by putting up [31 points and 9 rebounds in the Garden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-BPQ192bPQ), and as a result laid the foundation of his career, Pop’s career, and helped finish Robinson’s career on top. The Knicks haven't been the same since.


**3.	Career High 53 Points Against Dallas**

In 2001, Tim Duncan scored [53 out of San Antonio’s 123 points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9wOz1fBtmg) in a loss to Dirk Nowitzki and the Mavericks. Despite a loss to the division rival, it's a classic performance to watch regardless of the outcome.

**4.	Tim Duncan Ends The Lakers Run In 2003**

The Lakers were coming off a three-peat from 2000-2002, looking for a fourth consecutive championship. The Lakers knocked San Antonio out two years in a row from 2001-2002, and Tim Duncan had enough as he dropped [37 points and 16 rebounds in game 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_iN6qwvoS8) to send the Spurs to another championship and sent the Lakers home with tears in their eyes. Final score 110-82. Absolute savage. 

**5.	The Quadruple Double**

Game 6 in the 2003 Finals against the New Jersey Nets, Tim Duncan’s official stat line was [20 rebounds, 21 points, 10 assists, and 8 blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nejQMtkyLgY). One of the greatest finals performances of all time, although many NBA fans including myself beg to question that stat line. The official records say it isn’t a quadruple-double, but in the great words of Rasheed Wallace, [“ball don’t lie!”](https://youtu.be/kH0-QR9IzM4?t=22) 

Around [5:38](https://youtu.be/nejQMtkyLgY?t=337) and [5:58](https://youtu.be/nejQMtkyLgY?t=355) are the two blocks that did not count towards the stat sheet. Nobody knows why they didn’t count, but in our hearts, we all know a quadruple-double was achieved by Tim Duncan in the NBA finals.

**6. Fall-away Jumper Against the Lakers**

Series tied 2-2 against the Lakers, time running out, Tim Duncan hits [one hell of a shot](https://youtu.be/NSnAvhvfniw?t=33) to put the Spurs up 73-72. This shot is irrelevant for most casual fans as it was erased by Derek Fisher’s infamous shot make with .04 left on the clock where San Antonio eventually loses to the Lakers that series. If that shot didn’t count, who knows what would have happened that series. 


**7.	Ejected For Laughing**

If you are unaware of this moment in NBA history, get yourself prepared. A regular season matchup in April of 2007 against the Dallas Mavericks, referee [Joey Crawford stared down a smiling Tim Duncan and threw him out of the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2SYIrUnf5Y). This is quite possibly the most insane ejection in NBA history, and who better to be on the receiving end than Mr. Fundamental himself.


**8.	2005 Finals MVP** 

[Tim Duncan averaged 20 points and 14 rebounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5qLg7b_NqQ) against one of the best defensive teams in the league and the combination of Tim and Manu against the Detroit Pistons was a force to be reckoned with. The Pistons were coming off a championship in 2004 after taking care of the Lakers in a 4-1 victory, and if you’re able to handle Shaq and Kobe in 5 games you’d be able to take care of anyone in the league. Tim Duncan was able to give the Pistons a run for their money against their brick wall defense and emerged victorious with a finals MVP to boot. 


**9.	Western Conference Semifinals Game 7**

After being down 3-1 in the series against the Mavericks, the Spurs turned it around to force a game 7 and [Duncan put up a staggering 41 points, 15 rebounds, 6 assists and 3 blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inR1UKJk2dI). Unfortunately, his efforts weren’t enough as Dallas beat the Spurs 119-111 in overtime, but the heroics displayed here by Tim are admirable. He did everything he possibly could to will his team to the next round, but a 6-0 run by the Mavs in overtime sealed the deal. 


**10.	Clutch Three-Pointer Against The Suns**

[With three seconds left, Gregg Popovich draws up a play for Tim Duncan to hit a three.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdsKp94Io0) A career 18% three-point shooter, Tim Duncan with ice in his veins sends the game into double overtime in a playoff win against the Seven-Seconds-Or-Less Suns. One of the few times you’ll see Tim with pure emotion on the court.

**11.	Playing With His Kids During Halftime in the NBA Finals**

Gregg Popovich instills the philosophy that there are things greater than basketball to all of his players. 

[“If I just did basketball, I’d be bored to death. How much satisfaction can you get out of doing jump shots and teaching someone to deny in the passing lanes?”](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-san-antonio-spurs-are-coached-to-think-for-themselves-1475768553)

Tim Duncan displays such a mindset. During halftime against the Heat in 2013, [Tim takes the time to sit in the hallway with his three kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly9cnpqn4-s&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=10s). It doesn’t matter if it’s one of the biggest games in one of the best finals series in recent history, there is always a greater cause to attend to.

**12.	Game 6 2013 Finals**

During this series, Duncan averaged 19 points and 12 boards but took it into overdrive in game 6 as he was looking to seal the deal. [30 points and 17 boards, on 62% field goal shooting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iviKH8dnNY4). Duncan absolutely dismantled Bosh, and if it weren’t for [Ray Allen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6XsZVb-ZE ), this would have gone down as one of the greatest finals performances of all time. 


**13.	Tim Sends it to Triple Overtime**

[Such a similar shot to the one he pulled off against the Lakers, but just as entertaining.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGXzzODv1yM&amp;app=desktop) Tim sends it to triple overtime during the regular season in a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. The Spurs went on to play another triple overtime game against the Blazers two days later.

**14.	HEB Commercials**

If you haven’t heard of the HEB commercials with the Spurs, then you’ve been missing out. I could have made a list of 21 Tim Duncan moments from HEB commercials alone, but here are some [Tim Duncan highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ojzKDCssIg) from those ads. If you want to watch the ads, check them out over [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSYbBJiSe9c) and [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvVDRb9vl7Y)

**15.	Tim Duncan Breaks Amir Johnson’s Ankles**

No words, just [pure fundamental handles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEuu3NmF400) at age 37. [Amir took it pretty well too when Timmy announced his retirement.](https://www.facebook.com/AmirJohnsonNBA/photos/a.152180093355.146679.138324698355/10154961614028356/?type=3&amp;theater
) 

**16.	Tim Duncan Outplays DeMarcus Cousins**

[The video starts off with Tim Duncan being pushed to the ground by DeMarcus Cousins.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVVaMEHmvAE) As the game progresses, Cousins begins to become more aggressive, dropping shoulders into Duncan, and Duncan simply cannot believe the murder that is going on the court. As time goes on, Duncan progressively displays his dominance over Cousins letting his skills talk rather than his emotions. A testament to who Duncan was on the court. 


**17.	Fadeaway Against The Thunder In Game 6 Overtime**

[A mismatch against Reggie Jackson turns into a baseline fadeaway that bounces in to send Tim Duncan to his 5th ring.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r2qx9X3AC8) This was no easy shot as Jackson has a 7 foot wingspan, and to top it off, Russell Westbrook gambles on the steal and still manages to come in for the double team. Tim doesn’t care, and shows a pep in his step as he turns away from the Thunder.


**18.	“We’ll Do It This Time”**

This is one of my favorite moments that defines who Duncan is a player. Calm, professional, determined. [In a post-game interview with David Aldridge](https://youtu.be/kAbwFcQJMv4?t=258
), you can hear the assurance and drive in Duncan’s voice to perform and ultimately get a fifth ring for the city of San Antonio.  

**19.	His Last Championship**

You could combine his Thunder post-game interview with this, but the emotional context differs enough for me to define it as two separate moments. [The sweetest championship according to the man himself](https://youtu.be/OkulZHNINq0?t=3321) and most Spurs fans alike. After a crushing 7 game series against the Miami Big 3 in 2013, the Spurs played quite possibly the most well-executed series you’ve ever seen. Shooting 53% overall as a team that series, and 46% from three, the Spurs played [The Beautiful Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3y7cWmoBCI) to reclaim the throne as NBA champions. 

**20.	Game 7 Against The Clippers**

I believe that this was the true finale for the Duncan saga. Not last year’s playoff exit against the Thunder, but the year prior against the Clippers. In one of the greatest playoff series in history, at the age of 38, Duncan posted up a tremendous 27 points and 11 rebounds on 68% FG shooting in game 7. The only other two players in the NBA at that age or greater who put up a similar stat line in the playoffs are Kareem and Karl Malone. Duncan also had a 28 point and 11 rebound game in game 2 of that Clippers series. Along with the numbers, the emotion displayed is just as strong between Chris Paul and Duncan. [CP3 hits the game winner over his childhood hero, and CP3 shares a heartfelt moment with Duncan. Legendary night for both ends of the floor.](https://youtu.be/-WSm1upEx5Q?t=303)


**21.	The Retirement Letter**

[Tim walks off congratulating the Thunder after 113-99 loss to send the Spurs home.](https://youtu.be/hhXa-l9mkPM?t=25) He walks off gracefully into the tunnel, and as a Spurs fan watching this game, you just expect Timmy to come back next season. Sure he didn’t play the greatest that series, but defeat never got in the way of Duncan as seen during the Miami Heat finals era. Later that summer, Tim announces retirement, and everyone is shocked. Leaving nothing more than a [letter](http://cdn1.thecomeback.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/duncanletter.jpg) and a legacy, Tim Duncan walks away from the game of basketball, closing another chapter of an era we’ve all grown to love.

**Current Era Recap**

*(Credit to /u/fuggingolliwog)*


Denver's professional basketball history dates back to 1969 and the Denver Rockets of the ABA. In 1969, Denver drafted rookie Spencer Haywood directly out of high school. He would win the ABA Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year Awards that year, before signing with the SuperSonics for his sophomore year. In 1974, Denver's franchise officially changed its name to the Denver Nuggets, so as not to be confused with the Houston Rockets of the NBA. The Nuggets had early success under coach Larry Brown, with the play of future Hall of Famers Dan Issel and two-time number one draft pick (ABA and NBA) “The Skywalker” David Thompson. In 1976, the Nuggets went to the ABA finals, only to lose 4-2 to Dr. J's New York Nets. The next season, the ABA and NBA merged.

In 1981, Doug Moe became the head coach of the Nuggets and instituted a brand of fast-paced ""motion"" offense that would become a staple of Nuggets play for years to come. In 1987, he became the first Nugget's head coach to become Coach of the Year. This era is defined by the high-scoring offense of Alex English and Kiki Vandeweghe. The Nuggets would lead the league in scoring and set the all-time record for highest average points per game at 126.5 PPG in '81-'82.

The Nuggets went into a period of decline and rebuilding for many years until drafting Dikembe Mutombo in '91. In the 1993-1994 playoffs the Nuggets made history by becoming the first 8th seed to defeat a 1st seed (the Seattle SuperSonics) in 5 games.

Another period of mediocrity ensued for a number of years before the Nuggets landed the #3 pick in the loaded 2003 Draft and selected Carmelo Anthony. Anthony would immediately become the face of the franchise and along with the hiring of head coach George Karl in 2004, the Nuggets began a period of growth that resulted in ten (and counting) consecutive playoff appearances. However, these Nuggets teams would only manage to get out of the first round of the playoffs one year, in 2009, reaching the Western Conference Finals to take the defending champion Lakers to six games.

The 2010-2011 season marked the end of the Melo era when after months of speculation and frustration, he was traded to the New York Pants in a blockbuster deal that would bring Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, and Timofey Mozgov (along with several others) to Denver. Many believed that this version of the Nuggets would suffer from not having a go-to ""All-Star"" scorer but the team became a more consistent threat, relying on athleticism and teamwork to overpower opponents.

**2012-2013 Season Recap** 

*(Credit to /u/fuggingolliwog)*


* Franchise record 57-25 winning season

* 38-3 NBA best home record

* Franchise record 15 game win streak

* NBA record in points in the paint per-game (57.3 Points Per Game). 

* Despite languishing under a season-ending injury to star small forward Danilo Gallinari, the Nuggets finished the season with the third best record in the West.

**The Playoffs** 

*(Credit to /u/fuggingolliwog)*


Seen to be perennial underachievers in the post-season under George Karl, the Nuggets were once again eliminated in the first round of the playoffs - this time by Mark Jackson and the Golden State Warriors. Shortly after the end of the season the Nuggets front office would experience a massive metamorphosis - Executive of the Year Masai Ujiri would return to Toronto, Assistant GM Pete D'Alessandro would leave to take up the GM role in Sacramento, and Coach of the Year George Karl was let go. 

**2013-2014**

*(Credit to /u/fuggingolliwog)*


What does next year hold for the Nuggets? Only time will tell. We have a promising young core with Ty Lawson, Kenneth Faried, and Danilo Gallinari, complemented by free-agent acquisitions Nate Robinson, Randy Foye, and JJ Hickson, and a much sought-after rookie head coach in Brian Shaw. Some fans are doom-saying, truly believing that our 10 year playoff streak will come to an end but I, personally, am very optimistic.

**2013 Draft Notes**

**Rudy Gobert** | C | Cholet Basket/France |

Drafted by Denver but traded to Utah. A lanky 7’1” pivot, Gobert set NBA Draft Combine records for wingspan (7 feet 8 1/2 inches) and standing reach (9 feet 7 inches) in the 2013 combine.

**Erick Green** | PG | Virginia Tech |

Received in return for the rights to Rudy Gobert, Green, the NCAA’s leading scorer (25.0 PPG) last season with the Hokies will play 2013-2014 with Montepaschi Siena in Italy.

**Joffrey Lauvergne** | PF/C | France |

Denver acquired Lauvergne (along with Darrell Arthur) via trade on June 27, 2013 for Kosta Koufos. Lauvergne is currently attached to KK Partizan of the Serbian League.

**GM:** Joe Dumars

**Coach:** Maurice ""Mo"" Cheeks (formerly Lawrence Frank)

**Current Era Recap**

After a long stretch of success following their Championship in 2004, the Pistons have been suffering through a playoff drought since the Cavs swept the Pistons in 2009. In that off-season Joe Dumars, the GM responsible for assembling the 2004 Championship team, signed then-promising reserves Ben Gordon and Charlie Villanueva. As most know, those players were not able to make the leap under the burden of their added responsibilities.

Since trading the 2004 Finals MVP, Chauncey Billups for Allen Iverson in 2008 and then letting Iverson walk in the offseason, the Pistons back court has been very unstable. Rodney Stuckey, a 1st rounder from 2007, never was able to cement himself as the floor general while Gordon and Hamilton competed over floor time at the 2-spot. 

Gordon, who won the Sixth Man of the Year award in his rookie season, failed to produce at his pre-Pistons  level. Part of the problem was the fact that Rip already occupied the role of shooting guard. Due to the crowded backcourt, Gordon played ten less minutes per game in his first season with the Pistons and his scoring average fell approximately 7 points. His three point percentage also suffered, dropping from 41% to 32.1%. Oddly, Gordon scored worse in 2009-10 than he did his rookie season, where he played three and a half less minutes per game (24.4 in 2004-05 to 27.9 in 2009-10). Gordon's floor time would continue to hover around that level for his entire tenure with the Pistons, starting only 65 of the 196 games he played with the Pistons. 

Villanueva also didn't pan out. However, he does not have the same excuses that Gordon could use. Villanueva seems to have stopped caring as soon as he landed in Detroit. In his first season, he played 23.7 m/g, compared to his then-career average of 26.3 m/g. His scoring numbers fell almost 5 points from the previous season and his grabbed two less rebounds. His rebounding numbers would continue to fall during his time, as his poor play cost him minutes. 

Coach John Kuester was unable to continue the Pistons' streak of playoff appearances and had difficulty managing the roster. After a rough year, finishing 27-55, the Pistons picked Georgetown big man Greg Monroe 7th overall. 

Monroe entered a severely undermanned team though, and the team finished 30-52 for that year. Moreover, the 2010-11 Pistons had an out right locker room revolt near the All-Star break. Days after Hamilton unleashed an expletive laced tirade upon Kuester, the Pistons vets staged a boycott of practice after no changes were made with either the roster or coaching staff at the trade deadline.

After another lackluster year and losing control of a good deal of the team, Kuester was fired before the 2011-12 season. Hamilton was also waived before the start of the season, leaving Tayshaun Prince and Ben Wallace as the last Pistons for the 2004 Championship roster.  Former Nets Coach Lawrence Frank sat at the helm for the lock-out season, despite a slow start, the Pistons went .500 after the All Star break.

Since the 2008-09 season, the Pistons have had three different coaches. Lawrence Frank led the team through two disappointing seasons and was fired in the offseason after demanding more security if he be brought back for the final year of his contract. 

During this same stretch of time, the ownership has changed hands. Longtime Owner Bill Davidson passed away in 2009. Karen Davidson did not push Dumars to make many moves after the Ben Gordon/Charlie Villanueva signing disaster, and the Pistons languished in sub-par purgatory for the next four seasons as a cost. Choosing to keep veteran players kept us out of the top-5 in the lottery, and thus kept us around the same spot for four straight drafts. After a deal fell through with Red Wings and Tigers owner Mike Illitch, Multi-Billionaire Tom Gores became the owner of the Pistons after a bit of financial finagling. Gores came in with an optimistic outlook of his young roster, already claiming they were a few years out of the playoffs. Prior to the 2012-13 season, he stated the playoffs were a possibility. Then the season started and reality smacked us down with the force of a [Ben Wallace block](http://youtu.be/R7mTLgEUniA).

* [Top Plays of the season](http://www.nba.com/pistons/video/2013/04/18/PHPlaysoftheYear2mp4-2451700) 

* The Pistons drafted Andre Drummond 9th (my personal thanks go out to the Bobcats’, Wizards’, Cavs’, Kings’, Blazers’, Warriors’, and Raptors’ front offices) overall in 2012 and quickly learned that they have a promising prospect on their hands. The year had few highlights besides the young Drummond's flickers of athletic brilliance. 

* Before training camp, Dumars packaged Ben Gordon and a top-5 protected 2014 1st round pick in exchange for Corey Maggette's expiring contract. Maggette would play limited minutes for the first part of the season before being pushed to the end of the bench.

* While he allegedly stayed in game-shape, there is no roster spot available for Ben Wallace. (Maybe this year?)

* Despite closing out the past season in respectable fashion, the 2012-13 season began with an eight game losing streak which began with their home opener and dragged through a seven game west coast road trip. 

* At the trade deadline the Pistons packaged Tayshaun Prince and Austin Daye to Memphis in a three team deal that brought in Jose Calderon from the Raptors. With the experienced floor general Calderon joining the team, Brandon Knight moved over to the shooting guard position. This event also allowed us to weed out all of those bandwagon Tayshaun Prince fans that half-heartedly followed our team nation wide. What's that? [This guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNb8kqmxO7I) was the only one? Good riddance anyways.

* The Pistons were able to string together consecutive wins ten times during the season, winning back to back games four times and posting two four game win streaks (from December 28 through January 4 and from April 7 through April 15). More disturbingly, of the Pistons' twenty-nine wins, only nine came against playoff teams and three of those defeated playoff teams were the Bucks (the other six were the C's twice, the Heat, the Hawks, the Spurs, and the Bulls). 

* Drummond missed a stretch of games from early February through Late March, but was quickly given a starting role after playing off the bench prior to his injury. Coach Frank's decision not to start Drummond was questioned for much of the season. 

* Drummond impressed with both his athleticism and his ability to rebound at the offensive end. He grabbed 15.4% of the available offensive rebounds and 27.2% of the available defensive rebounds.

* The Pistons had an incredibly high assist to turnover ratio, tying the Thunder and the Nets for the 27th spot, coming behind the Rockets and before the Pacers. Of those teams, two place in the top ten (Rocket, Thunder) for pace and two place in the bottom ten (Pacers and Nets with the Pistons). 

* Young core-members, Monroe and Knight would have unimpressive years respectively, not showing much growth. What's truly impressive is how stagnant Knights numbers were over his first two seasons. While played roughly a minute less per game from his rookie season, Knight averaged identical FG/g (4.8), FGA/g (11.7), and 3PTM/g (1.6). Knight's shooting percentages fell though from 41.5% to 40.7% in general and from 38% to 36.7% from behind the arc. He dished nearly the same amount of assists per game and his turnovers increased slightly. Monroe shot worse both from the field and from the line compared to 2011-12, but I wouldn't worry too much about that. He was able to add an extra assist to his average from last year, but other than that he had a pretty stagnant year as well. 

* In lieu of going .500 after the all-star break again, the Pistons hoped to closed out the season with a season high five game win streak that was spoiled in the season finale by the Brooklyn Nets.

nba,[OC] A history of the many times the Warriors appreciated and respected Kevin Durant,"There have been a lot of recent reports about how KD felt under appreciated by the Warriors organization and fanbase. Here's a collection of some of the many times the Warriors embraced him:

**January 2017:** [The Warriors invite KD to the Chase Center groudbreaking ceremony.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2687604-warriors-turn-chase-center-groundbreaking-ceremony-into-elaborate-show) He's the only Warrior in attendance (Steph reportedly wanted the day off). 

**February 2017:** OKC fans make cupcake shirts in preparation for KD's first game back since leaving the Thunder. Steph and Draymond wear these shirts after the game as a way to support and defend their teammate.

&gt;[Steph Curry took a cupcake T-shirt with him to the locker room. ""It's a souvenir for bigger and better things,"" he said.](https://twitter.com/tim_cato/status/830633050887303169)

**June 2017:** [Steph talks about embracing KD and being happy to have him as a teammate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1GHEZ4wEnA)

&gt;""To be in a position where a guy like KD can see himself gelling with our team, with myself, it's a special feeling... I know I'm not bigger than anybody else on the team.""

**June 2017:** [Kerr praises KD at the 2017 championship parade.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKlM5bLssUo) Fun fact: He forgets to mention Steph.

&gt;""KD, the one question I had coming into this year was 'Could he bring it defensively, every single night?' We saw it in the playoffs last year how dominant he can be, and in the Finals and throughout the playoffs. Wow. Is he a point guard? Is he a rim-protecting center? I don't know, the guy's just an incredible two-way basketball player who just won the MVP for the Finals and had an amazing series.”

**June 2017:** [Kerr, in an interview with Zach Lowe, gives KD some high praise following their 2017 championship calling him the second best player behind Lebron and putting him ahead of Steph.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6hbuv4/steve_kerrvia_lowe_post_steph_is_one_of_the_great/)

&gt;""I'm just thrilled it ended the way it did where not only did he win a championship, but he was the MVP of the Finals. So nobody can say he jumped on the bandwagon. He drove it. He had some co-pilots.""

&gt;""Steph is one of the great players in the world. Two time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of the way he impacts the game. **But, you’re talking about Kevin Durant at 6’11 protecting the rim, getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do. There’s a different level of impact that is actually possible for Steph and for KD.** Steph is my size. He’s literally my size. So, what he’s capable of is all based on his amazing skill. He can’t do anything about being 6’3 and a buck seventy-five. So, in the playoffs especially when you’re having to protect the rim and do so many different things. There has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you’re having these conversations about who’s the best player in the league. **And that’s why Lebron is there, that’s why Kawhi is there, that’s why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force.**""

**August 2017:** KD takes a jab at Under Armour despite teammate Steph Curry being their biggest star: ""Nobody wants to play in Under Armours, I’m sorry. The top kids don’t because they all play Nike.""

&gt;Steph squashes rumors of any problems by posting a picture with KD on instagram: [Why so serious?!? \#sneakerwars](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZ3Zf-bgIFV/)

**June 2018:** [Steve Kerr offers high praise following KD's game 3 performance in the finals.](https://twitter.com/warriors/status/1004785154706018304)

&gt;""That was amazing what he did out there... Some of those shots, I don't think anybody in the world can hit those but him. He was incredible.""

**October 2018:** [The Warriors announce KD last to get his ring.](https://youtu.be/mE1NYp4SM_k?t=495) The last spot was normally reserved for Steph in years prior.

**November 2018:** Steph Curry offers some high praise for KD's skills.

&gt;[""He's such a versatile scorer. He can get it all sorts of different ways. Sometimes you don't need to call a play for him and he'll magically end up with 25-30 points just because of his sheer talent and ability and IQ.""](https://twitter.com/warriors/status/1058120246354034688)

**November 2018:** [The Warriors invite KD to tour Chase Center as it's being built.](https://twitter.com/NickFriedell/status/1061037445163102208) He's the first Warrior invited.

**November 2018:** [Warriors suspend Draymond following his angry altercation with KD.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25269250/draymond-green-golden-state-warriors-suspended-dust-up)

&gt;""We just felt like this rose to the level of acting the way that we did,"" Warriors general manager Bob Myers said at a news conference before Tuesday night's game in Oakland. ""That's a decision that we have to make. I'm certainly involved in it, so is Steve. This was something that required the action that we decided upon.""

**January 2019:** [Kerr talks about needing to put the ball in KD's hands more.](https://twitter.com/DrewShiller/status/1081077674997571584) This was controversial among Warriors fans because Steph is known to go several minutes without touching the ball while running around screens.

&gt;“I don’t know if Kevin Durant touched the ball for about 5-6 minutes. That can’t happen. We’ve got to do a better job of getting him the ball.”

**January 2019:** [Kerr credits the Warriors' win over the Kings to KD despite Steph's 42 point game (which included 20 points in the 4th):](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/steve-kerr-kevin-durant-was-key-warriors-win-over-kings)

&gt;**""I thought Kevin was the key to the game the other night. Even though Steph had the 42 points and had a lot of the highlights -- I thought Kevin played a brilliant game from that point-forward role that he plays.** He had one turnover and even that was a little flukish -- the ball slipped out of his hands when he was going up for a jump shot.

&gt;""His decision making was brilliant. He kept making the simple play over and over again -- getting us wide open shots. He defended -- had a key block on a jump shot that led to a fastbreak, it was a big bucket for us.""

**January 2019:** Kerr explains that he drew up the final play against Dallas for KD, despite Steph having 45 points and 10 made threes at that point, and KD changed the play.

&gt;Kerr: [""KD's so unselfish. When he sees somebody going, he's going to try to get him the ball. In timeouts, a couple of times, I drew up a play for him and he said, 'Why don't Steph and I flip?'""](https://twitter.com/anthonyVslater/status/1084641399134478336)

**February 2019:** KD decides to stop talking to the media for a while due to too much free agency buzz. [Kerr defends his decision:](https://twitter.com/anthonyVslater/status/1093329078780751872) 

&gt;""He just doesn't feel like talking right now. We're functioning as a team, we're doing our thing, we're playing, he's coming in and competing and working at practice. It's just...give him some space.""

**April 2019:** [Kerr compares KD's playoff run to Michael Jordan.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26629540/kerr-compares-durant-playoff-run-jordan)

&gt;""There's this guy named Michael something,"" Kerr said as the assembled media chuckled. ""Can't remember his last name. No, but Kevin's run this past week has just been off the charts. I've said it a few times this week: He's the most skilled basketball player on Earth. He's one of the most skilled basketball players to ever play the game. There's never been anybody like him.""

nba,Who is Khris Middleton? [OC],"[Khris Middleton](http://i.imgur.com/FwJDpLg.jpg)

Today's story focuses on an up-and-comer in the NBA, on one of the most interesting young teams in the NBA - the Milwaukee Bucks. The Bucks have had a tumultuous season to say the least. Defensive anchor Larry Sanders was waived after he claimed he needed a break from the NBA, 20 year old Rookie sensation Jabari Parker was ruled out for the season after tore his ACL in December and the team traded away promising young point guard Brandon Knight for a more defensive-minded yet seemingly less effective Michael Carter-Williams.

[Larry - ""I'm Out!""](http://i.imgur.com/wf1qsIL.jpg)

The team has since been in a downward spiral. However, Milwaukee has found a silver lining. Khris Middleton, in his third NBA season, has been the bright spot during the Bucks' recent skid. And thanks to his stretch of superior play in the past few months, Middleton has exploded into the scene, suddenly becoming one of the most interesting free agents of the 2015 offseason. All this sensation seemed to reach it's peak just days ago, when Middleton hit a miraculous buzzer beater against the Miami Heat.

**EARLY LIFE**
***
James Khristian Middleton was born August 12, 1991 in Charleston South Carolina to James and Nichelle Middleton. Additionally, Middleton is the cousin of NBA free agent Josh Powell and current Wichita State basketball player Kenny Manigualt. In interviews, Middleton comes off as a poised, yet laid back individual, reflecting his average and seemingly uneventful upbringing.

[Middleton as a Young Player](http://i.imgur.com/e3HCml6.jpg)

**HIGH SCHOOL**
***
Middleton began playing from a young age, and participated in AAU ball, playing for the Carolina Celtics until High School. Middleton attended Porter-Gaud School, a coed prep school in Charleston which was first formed by the merging of several military prep schools. Through high school, Middleton quickly established himself as an elite player - his Junior year he averaged 21 points and 8.6 rebounds per game and his Senior year he averaged 22.4 points and 8.6 rebounds. Thanks to Middleton's terrific season, the Porter-Guad Cyclones reached the state championship. Although the team lost the championship, Middleton was named an All-State player and awarded the Championship MVP. College recruiters recognized his talent, ranking Middleton as the 64th best high school player in the nation and the best shooting Small Forward. Following his senior year, Middleton elected to sign with the Texas A&amp;M Aggies.

His Freshman year at A&amp;M, Middleton played limited minutes and was mostly utilized in order to fill the shoes of three point shooter Josh Carter who had graduated the previous year. However, guard Derrick Roland suffered a career ending injury, which opened up a spot for Middleton to play - starting 18 of the last 20 games of the season. Middleton's sophomore year saw even more improvement and he had his best collegiate season. Middleton lead the team in scoring and placed ninth in scoring in the Big 12. Middleton also put up career highs in all major statistical categories except blocks during his sophomore year - 14.3ppg, 2.8asts, and 5.2 rebounds, all while shooting 45% from the field, 36.1% from 3 and 78.4% from the free throw line. Thus, his sophomore year, Middleton established himself as a well rounded offensive player. Although he didn't put up impressive numbers on defense, it was apparent that he had potential. His junior year, Middleton continued to build his skillset, but unfortunately struggled with a knee injury all year that caused him to regress. NBA scouts recognized Middleton's talent as an excellent shot creator with an effective midrange game. But Middleton struggled in catch-and-shoot situations, and recruits claimed he would be a role player if he didn't develop a better three point shot. Injuries also caused concerns and play on a weaker team and lack of playoff experience dropped his stock ([Source](http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Khris-Middleton-6332/)). Thus, Middleton was selected 39th by the Detroit Pistons.

**DETROIT PISTONS**
***
During Middleton's Rookie year, he once again saw little court action. Middleton bounced between the Pistons and their D-League affiliates, the Fort Wayne Mad Ants, playing 27 games for the Pistons. Middleton averaged 6.1 points and 1.9 rebounds per game, while shooting 44% from the field. The Pistons had other plans for Middleton however, as he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks along with Brandon Knight and Viacheslav Kravtsov, in exchange for guard Brandon Jennings.

**FIRST YEAR IN MILWAUKEE**
***
Once Middleton arrived in Milwaukee, he was fortunate enough able to gain a starting position. In contrast to his rookie year, Middleton was the only Bucks player to play all 82 games of the season. Although Milwaukee hoped to reach the playoffs, they were absolutely devastated by injuries - finishing with a franchise record and NBA worst 17- 67.

[How the Bucks felt about last season](http://i.imgur.com/nqqlU8S.jpg)


But, due to the team's bad luck, Middleton was able to gain a large amount of NBA experience as a starter. In his second NBA season, Middleton nearly doubled his scoring output (12.1ppg), upped his rebounding (3.8rpg) and increased his three point shooting percentage (41.4%). The increase in these statistics is almost certainly due to the small sample size his rookie campaign, but his improvement was tangible through the eye test.

[Dunking Against Toronto](http://i.imgur.com/M6YpBg7.jpg)
***
**WHAT'S NEXT?**

Thus far this year, Middleton has been a recent source of consistency in yet another chaotic Bucks' season. Head coach Larry Drew was fired before the season, and new coach Jason Kidd (who caused some controversy in his first year in Brooklyn) took the helm.

[Apparently Done to Stall the Game](http://i.imgur.com/aagKJr9.gifv)

[What the Brooklyn Nets Think of Kidd's Brief Coaching Stint](http://gfycat.com/EagerDevotedIndochinesetiger)

This year however, Jason Kidd has one of the youngest squads in the NBA, rather than the underwhelming and ancient star-power based lineup Brooklyn traded their future away for. With the new squad, Kidd has gained a fresh new start and an opportunity to create a new culture in Milwaukee. In fact, Kidd requires players to take written tests before every game, which encourages players to study game film and discuss strategies with teammates ([source](http://grantland.com/the-triangle/milwaukees-makeover-how-the-bucks-decided-to-buckle-down-and-play-for-the-future/)). 
And throughout this year, Jason Kidd has developed a terrifyingly effective defense so far this season, with an emphasis on players with long wingspans in order to cover as much of the floor as possible. And it's a bit unusual and risky. In pick-and-roll situations, a third man slides from the opposite side of the floor, in order to cover the pick man that starts cutting to the basket. The problem in these situations is that a man is left wide open on the opposite side of the floor, but the Bucks have players that are quick and gangly enough that they can prevent the pass most of the time.

[Example of the Bucks' Unusual Strategy (Courtesy of Grantland)](http://i.imgur.com/oH5oT9a.png)

The shortest starter on the team is now Michael Carter-Williams, who stands at 6'6"", and the average height of the starting lineup right now is 6'9"". Kidd has developed a team of gangly, giant athletic freaks who serve simply to stop the other team from scoring. After Brandon Knight was traded and OJ Mayo came down to earth, the Bucks seriously needed some firepower and three shooting. Enter Khris Middleton.
***
Since the All-Star break, Middleton is averaging 17.7ppg while shooting an impressive 44.3% from three, 45.3% from the field overall, and 86.7% from the free throw line. He's also taken a larger role on the team - with a usage rate of 21.6% in that same time period. Additionally, Middleton is top 10 in real plus minus. All the while, Middleton brings some exceptional defense to the table as well - putting up numbers remarkably similar to 3 and D specialist Wes Matthews. 

[Table 1](http://i.imgur.com/wFeqPZ0.png)

[Table 2](http://i.imgur.com/xWwbH37.png)

[Table 3](http://i.imgur.com/ikSYytM.png)

Granted, some of these numbers might be skewed due to Wes Matthews' recent injury, but the two are surprisingly similar - statistics included or not. Both are crucial cogs in playoff teams, whose value is beyond many statistical measurements. In the future, I see Middleton's development helping him reach a higher ceiling than was previously predicted of him. He's going to pull in a boatload in free agency if he keeps up his recent play. Hopefully, this isn't an unusually good stretch of Middleton's career, and that we get to see more of this version of Khris Middleton.

**PERSONAL LIFE/TRIVIA**
***
Middleton claims his favorite sports team is the New York Yankees, his favorite athlete is Kobe Bryant, his favorite cereal is Lucky Charms, and his backup/ favorite midnight snack is Raisin Bran (interesting?). Additionally, he claimed to have a FIFA addiction, but quit playing recently in order to focus more on basketball. One of the most interesting things Middleton has done of the court since he's joined the NBA is milking a cow - for charity. Middleton literally milked a cow in front of a large group of kids at the Milwaukee State Fair for publicity and charity. That's about the most interesting thing I've found about him. Middleton comes off as a normal, mellow individual, which makes him even more relatable to the fans. Boring? Sure. But that's much better than many in the NBA.

nba,Who is the best team? An analysis.,"EDIT NOTE: DISREGARD MY SEEDING NUMBERS. AUTO-FORMAT FUCKED EVERYTHING UP AND MY NUMBERING MAKES NO SENSE

Sports are fun and full of competition. Many times in sports, the question gets asked, 

""Who is the best?""

Sometimes we point to wins or championships or records to say who is the best. This rarely gives a definite answer and fans will continue to argue, ""my team is best.""

So I have done all the necessary research to tell you without a doubt, who is the best. 

Some notes:
-Using the end of season rankings, teams were seeded 1 to 30. 

-To make an even 32 for a proper bracket, the 2 most recent team names, the Bobcats and the Supersonics have been revived and seeded 31 and 32, respectively. 

Let the games begin...

The first round is as follows:

(Picture a bracket in your mind)

UPPER LEFT

1. Rockets vs 32. Supersonics

17. Wizards vs 16. Bucks

24. Kings vs 9. Pacers

25. Bulls vs 8. Thunder

LOWER LEFT

29. Grizzlies vs 5. 76ers

20. Hornets vs 13. Timberwolves

21. Lakers vs 12. Spurs

28. Hawks vs 4. Celtics

UPPER RIGHT

2. Raptors vs 31. Bobcats

18. Clippers vs 15. Heat

23. Nets vs 10. Jazz

26. Magic vs 7. Trailblazers

LOWER RIGHT

30. Suns vs 6. Cavaliers

19. Pistons vs 14. Nuggets

22. Knicks vs 11. Pelicans 

27. Mavericks vs 3. Warriors


GAME 1 - Rockets vs Supersonics

In order to travel at supersonic speeds, you need to go at least 768mph. Rockets regularly exceed this with ease as the velocity of stuff in low earth orbit is over 17,000 mph. The New Horizons probe that went to Pluto was traveling over 36,000mph when it left earth. 

Result: Easy win for the Rockets. 

GAME 2 - Wizards vs Bucks

In all of my research, I couldn't find any examples of magic being used against deer, let alone any examples of magic successfully defeating deer. However, as we all know, Harry Potters ghost deer spirit thing was able to fight off the dementors when none of the other ghost animals could. We clearly have an example of a deer being used to successfully defeat some wizardry. 

Result: Bucks in a close one, Daniel Radcliffe drops 35. 

GAME 3 - Kings vs Pacers

As we all know, the Pacers are named for the Pace Car for the famous Indianapolis 500. Although a modern race car might have been a challenging opponent for kings of ancient times, there are apparently 27 nations remaing in the world whose ruler still retains the title of King. Although many are smaller nations, they undoubtedly have access to some level of modern military force. 

Result: Not even close. Kings obliterate the Pacers and conquer the entire state of Indiana. 

GAME 4 - Bulls vs Thunder

Without their partner, the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Thunder are left with nothing but sound and although cattle have more sensitive hearing than humans, their vision and sense of smell are what they rely on most. At most, the Thunder does nothing but startle the Bulls into a stampede, only making them stronger. 

Result: Bulls weather the storm. 

GAME 5 - Grizzlies vs 76ers

Bears were a big problem for the earliest settlers in the new world as well as the founders of our great country. Bears wreaked havoc on crops, livestock and people and usually had to be trapped, and  ganged up by groups in order to be killed. Although the early Americans had moderate success against bears, they only had to face black bears as grizzlies did not inhabit the east coast. Since grizzly bears are much more dangerous than black bears, we can say with near certainty that the early colonists would have not survived if they had to face grizzlies and America would have never been born. 

Result: Grizzlies maul the 76ers as well a few of the fans in attendance. 

GAME 6 - Hornets vs Timberwolves

Surprisingly, there is not alot of data on the effect of bee stings on wolves or whether or not wolves eat bees. Weird, I know. I've seen my dog kill a bee before but I've also seen him get stung, so no real conclusions could be made there either. So this came down to speed. We all know that enough bee stings can be fatal so theoretically a swarm could kill a wolf, BUT the top speed of an average bee is only 20mph whereas a wolf can run upwards of 35mph. So basically if bees were trying to kill a wolf, the wolf could run away, but if a wolf wanted to kill a bee, it could do so easily. 

Result: Timberwolves outlast the Hornets with speed and stamina. 

GAME 7 - Spurs vs Lakers

Ok so spurs actually serve a purpose in horseback riding whereas the Lakers simply get their name from being founded in Minnesota, land of a billion lakes or some shit. The fact that they didn't even bother to change their name when they moved to the land of maybe 3 lakes and a concrete river just shows a complete lack of effort. Really disappointing from such a storied franchise.
 
Result: Spurs win by forfeit, Lakers didn't even show up. 

GAME 8 - Hawks vs Celtics

Although hawks are formidable hunters in the bird world, the Celtics settled most of Europe starting in the late bronze age all the way up to the rise of the Roman Empire. At their peak, they were crazy, naked fighters that were feared by the ancient Greeks and Romans. 

Result: Celtic win with the all-around better game although the Hawks can shoot the lights out. 

GAME 9 - Raptors vs Bobcats

Sorry Bobcats, this one's a bloodbath.

Result: Raptors

GAME 10 - Clippers vs Heat

Clippers were some of the finest and fastest sailing ships of their time, primarily bringing cargo and goods to nearly every corner of the globe. Although we can't  say for sure how hot the Heat actually is, it's safe to say that a Clipper would have held up well sailing in the hot Miami sun. 

Result: Miami Heat can't melt wooden Clippers

GAME 11 - Nets vs Jazz

Good God, what a boring game. The official Spaulding nets used by the NBA are made of 100% polyester and although they are replaced quite regularly, high quality polyester netting has a life expectancy of at least 20 years. This is just long enough to outlast the entire Jazz Age which lasted from 1919 to 1938, 19 years max. 

Result: Nets, somehow. 

GAME 12 - Magic vs Trailblazers

I'll admit, I've never cared much about the Blazers, but let me tell you that after reading up on how they picked the name, I somehow cared even less. Apparently it won in a big vote and at the big name reveal, the owner or president or coach, (whoever gave the announcement, I really started to skim the article at this point) gave the corniest explanation about the new team 'blazing a trail for professional sports in Oregon' or something. I know, right?

Result: Magic by default. 

GAME 13 - Suns vs Cavs

Fuck... I mean, the Cavaliers were pretty badass swordsmen back in their day and could hold their own with the best of them but damn, the Sun? Really?

Result: All the Cavs are horrifically cooked to death before even reaching the outer atmosphere of the Sun.... J.R. Smith is on the Moon wondering where everyone is...

GAME 14 - Pistons vs Nuggets

I won't pretend to know as much about cars as my mechanic, but I feel like if you managed to get some chunks of gold inside the engine cylinders, it would fuck something up. Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know. I can't think of a matchup that even maked sense here. I mean a gold nugget vs a piston? Wtf? 

Result: Nuggets win, I think. No one really knew how to even keep score in this one. 

GAME 15 - Knicks vs Pelicans

I got bit by a pelican one time in Myrtle Beach and haven't liked them since. And I can safely say I have never felt intimidated or threatened by a pair of pants. 

Result: Pelicans 

GAME 16 - Mavericks vs Warriors

Warriors have existed in countless forms throughout the ages and are ingrained in every chapter of human history. The TV Western, 'Maverick' only lasted 5 seasons. 

Result: Warriors by a few thousand years. 


THE SECOND ROUND IS AS FOLLOWS:

LEFT

1. Rockets vs 16. Bucks

24. Kings vs 25. Bulls

29. Grizzlies vs 13. Timberwolves 

12. Spurs vs 4. Celtics 

RIGHT

2. Raptors vs 18. Clippers 

23. Nets vs 26. Magic 

30. Suns vs 14. Nuggets 

11. Pelicans vs 3. Warriors 


GAME 1 - Rockets vs Bucks 

I couldn't find any evidence of a time when these two ever went head to head so I'll have to extrapolate. It's simple, really. We've all seen how poorly deer hold up against regular old cars. And rockets are mor powerful than cars. So it's safe to assume that a buck wouldn't survive getting hit by a rocket. 

Result: Rocket has a considerable amount of red paste on the front but is otherwise unscathed. 

GAME 2 - Kings vs Bulls 

By most estimates, there are about 1.4 billion heads of cattle in the world. We can assume half of them, or about 700 million are Bulls. Although there are over 20 'kings' remaining in the world, many are from very small nations. The entire population of Europe is a little more than 700 million and I feel confident that if you replaced evert mam, woman and child in Europe with a full grown bull, they could easily take over more than half of the remaing kingdoms in the world. 

Result: Bulls win. 

GAME 3 - Grizzlies vs Timberwolves 

This is a tough one because even though both animals share a significant amount of territory with one another, and they frequently get into fights, rarely do fights go to the death. In nearly all cases, fights are over food such as a fresh kill and end with one side simply giving up and looking for food elsewhere. Although a grizzly would destroy a wolf one on one, that's not fair because a wolfs biggest strength is in the pack. I have to base my decision on a recent report from Yellowstone that shows that more grizzly bears are moving in and starting to force wolves out of areas that they used to control. 

Result: a very close fight, but the Grizzlies cime out on top. 

GAME 4 - Spurs vs Celtics 

Believe it or not but the earliest evidence of the spur being used dates back to... wait for it... the ancient Celts. You would think that this would be considered a clear win for the Celtics but I beg to differ. Although the Celtics possibly invented the spur, there is not alot of evidence that they used them to their full potential. The Celtics had very skilled horseback riding warriors that gave trouble to the likes of the Romans, but these mobile warriors were more of a specialty unit. Fast forward a thousand years or so to the Mongols. Free from the sporadic and lackadaisical use by the Celtics, the spur was used to it's full potential by Genghis Khan in mobilising one of the largest and most brutal armies the world has ever seen. Whithin his lifetime and that of his sons, the Mongolian Empire conquered a larger area than any empire in history. And they did it all on horseback. They couldn't have done it without the spurs. 

Result: Spurs conquer the known world. 

GAME 5 - Raptors vs Clippers 

If the award-winning documentary series,  Jurassic Park, has taught us anything, it's that dinosaurs can claw and smash their way through any material and that raptors in particular, are extremely intelligent. I think its safe to say that they could easily figure out how commandeer a clipper, disembowel the entire crew, and sail the seven seas as fearsome dino-pirates. 

Result: Raptors evolve to become Pirate Raptors. 

GAME 6 - Nets vs Magic

The Nets strugglesd against Jazz music for God's sake. Mere polyester doesn't last long at all against Magic. A simple fire spell is all it takes. 

Result: Magic, easily. 

GAME 7 - Suns vs Nuggets 

OH. MY. GOD. DO WE HAVE A GAME HERE. 
In a way it seems like the Suns are cheating. It's just not fair. I mean, come on... the Sun for fucks sake! You can literally take any team, and just fling them into the Sun just like that. Dead. Cooked. Done.... EXCEPT THE NUGGETS.... Strap in boys, it's time for science class. You see, the way a star works  is that you start with a giant ball of hydrogen. If that ball of hydrogen is big enough, the pressure in the center gets so great that hydrogen atoms start to fuse together and create Helium. This releases some energy and you have a star with a dense ball of helium at the center. If a star keeps growing the pressure in the center keeps going up and even the helium starts to fuse into even larger elements. This process continues through the first 26 elements of the periodic table until the star starts creating Iron. The fusion process to create Iron (and any heavier elements) actually LOSES energy. Once a star reaches this stage, it becomes a ticking time bomb. GOLD just happens to be significantly heavier than iron. Long story short, if we keep throwing gold into the sun, it'll eventually blow up. 

Result: Nuggets hit a buzzer-beater, Sun blows up. Ironically J.R. hit the shot. He thought he was still on the Nuggets. 

GAME 8 - Warriors vs Pelicans 

Pelicans had a really easy first round against a pair of pants. Not as lucky this time around. Any Warrior throughout history could kill a Pelican. Hell, any able-bodied person could take one out with a golf club. 

Result: I personally don't like it, but the Warriors keep on rolling. 

WOO BABY SECOND ROUND IN THE BOOKS!

HERE WE ARE FOR THE ELITE EIGHT AKA THE ROUND OF FLACCO:

LEFT 

1. Rockets vs 25. Bulls 

29. Grizzlies vs 12. Spurs

RIGHT

2. Raptors vs 26. Magic 

14. Nuggets vs. 3. Warriors 


GAME 1 - Rockets vs Bulls 

The most powerful rocket in history was the Saturn V which put people on the Moon. The Moon is roughly 250,000 miles away. If we assume that a full-grown Bull is 5 feet tall at the shoulders, and we stack all 700 million of them on top of one another, our bullstack reaches a hight of over 662,000 miles. 

Result: In undoubtedly the most scientific way possible, we prove that the Bulls win this one by double digits. 

GAME 2 - Grizzlies vs Spurs

Spurs are used to keep horses under control. Untill I see someone successfully saddle up a grizzly, hop on top and spur it in the ribs withput getting their face ripped off, I've got to give this one to the Grizzlies. 

Result: Grizzlies

GAME 3 - Raptors vs Magic 

I'm honestly very disappointed that I couldn't find a single book, movie, tv show, short story or video game pitting dinosaurs against magic. Not one. This is the battle we all need in our lives. Regardless I had to see how similar creatures held up. Turns out reptiles constantly do pretty well against magic. Snakes in Harry potter, Dragons in Skyrim, hell even that bigass, hammerhead lookin demon lizard thing killed Gandolf in the Lord of the Rings. Clear advantage to all things scaly and lizardy. 

Result: Raptors

GAME 4 - Nuggets vs Warriors 

As effective as warriors have been throughout the ages, they usually have one major weakness. Greed. For every epic story of triumph throughout history, there are just as many stories of backstabbing, usually in the name of money. Entire empires have come crumbling down over bags of shiny metal. 

Result: It seems the weakness of the Warriors is the lust for gold. One could say that some of the worst treachery imaginable is that of leaving those who believed in you to go off and chase gold elsewhere ;)


WE ARE DOWN TO THE FINAL FOUR!!! 

IN THE LEFT WE HAVE

25. Bulls vs 29. Grizzlies 


AND IN THE RIGHT WE HAVE

2. Raptors vs 14. Nuggets 

Left-ern Conference Finals 

Bulls vs Grizzlies 

This would be a gruesome fight and call me a horrible person, but I would pay good money to see it. Barring a lucky shot to the neck with the horns early on, I think the Grizzly bear wins this one in double overtime. 

Right-ern Conference Finals

Raptors vs Nuggets 

Unlike the Warriors who can be easily swayed by gold, the Raptor is a pure killing machine with no fondness for material possessions. Raptors remain focused and win convincingly. 

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN THE FINAL ROUND WE HAVE A MOTHERFUCKING GRIZZLY BEAR FIGHTING A MOTHERFUCKING RAPTOR. ARE YOU FUCKING HAPPY NOW?!

Bear claws can literally rip the front of a persons face off in one clean swipe but how would they work against thick raptor skin? I don't think the Grizzly has the tools or the quickness needed to take down a raptor. It just can't be done. 

Ladies and gentlemen, uncles and nephews, sons and LeFathers, I present to you, without a doubt, the greatest team ever,

THE MOTHERFUCKING TORONTO RAPTORS!!!!!!!

HOLY FUCK ITS 8PM, I SHOULD LEAVE WORK NOW

P.S. GO BROWNS. 
",314,61,2018-06-15,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8r75a9/who_is_the_best_team_an_analysis/
nba,Native players in NBA history,"**Bob Harrison:** Harrison was the primary SG during the Lakers' early run of titles with George Mikan ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/harribo02.html)). He was a 1x All-Star and a 3x champion, but he's most famous for hitting a half-court bomb of a buzzer beater to win Game 1 of the 1950 Finals. He was Hočąk, and while with the Lakers, Harrison served as president of the Minnesota-based North American Indian Society in 1951-52. Also during his time in Minneapolis, on a night when Harrison was honored by his team, a number of local tribes presented him with a deerskin jacket."" He has said that he tanned dark, and once when he was in the Marines he was made to sit in the back of the train because they thought he was black.

**Gene Conley:** Conley was part of the Cherokee Nation, which he was connected to through his mother's side of the family. Conley was a 3x NBA champion with the Celtics ('59-61), but he was more famous as a 6-ft-8 MLB pitcher where he was a 4x All Star (*including playing in both ASG's in '59*) and a World Series champ in 1957 with the Braves. Here are his [career stats in the NBA](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/conlege01.html).

**Phil Jordon:** He was a decent center from '59-62 ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordoph01.html)), and his biggest claim to fame was that he did NOT play in the game where Wilt scored 100 points. Jordon was the Knicks' starting center in '62 --and their only regular starter taller than 6-ft-6-- but he drank an entire case of beer the night before the game and sat out ""sick"", so the already awful Knicks who had a horrible front court had no chance against the Warriors and Wilt who had a historic day of stat hoarding. Jordon is often named as the first Native player in league history, but this confusion seems to be because he was the first player *easily identifiable to most people* as Native.

**Gary Gray:** Gray was part of the Delaware Nation while growing up in Oklahoma. He played sparingly for the Royals during the '68 season ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/grayga01.html)) and was then selected by the Bucks in the 1968 Expansion Draft, but he never played beyond that 1 season in Cincinnati. 

**Sonny Dove:** Dove's mother was Mashpee Wampanoag and after he had a fantastic college career at St. John's, he was the #4 pick in the 1967 draft by the Pistons (*1 pick before Walt Frazier*). He played sparingly with Detroit for 2 years, then he went to the ABA's Nets for 3 seasons ('70-72), averaging 14 ppg and 8 rpg during his first 2 seasons in NY ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/doveso01.html)). His career ended early due to a bicycle accident, and he went on to earn his degree and announce St. John's games until his death in 1983. Dove and Gray did both play in a single game against each other during the '68 season ([box score](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196801300CIN.html)), playing a combined 3 minutes, so it's unlikely they were on the court at the same time unless they both appeared in the final minute of garbage time of Cincinnati's 20-point win.

**John Starks:** Starks has been referred to as ""Oklahoma born-and-raised Muscogee (Creek) Nation athlete John Starks"". He had an insane backstory that led to his NBA career (*4 different colleges, spent a couple years in 2 leagues that both collapsed, and the Knicks were forced to keep him in '90 when he got injured during a pre-season practice while attempting a dunk on Ewing*) who went on to be a beloved Knick who played with fiery passion and shot a ton of 3's. He was named an All Star in '94 when NY went to the Finals, was All-D in '93, and the '97 6th Man of the Year ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/starkjo01.html)). 

**Bison Dele:** According to Wikipedia, ""he was of African-American and Cherokee descent."" He was a decent rebounder and finisher near the hoop ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/delebi01.html)), but he's most well known as a player for winning a ring with the '97 Bulls. He had an extremely interesting personal life, playing multiple instruments, being an avid adventure traveler, flying planes, and dating Madonna, but his biggest headlines were made for his bizarre disappearance and presumed murder at sea in 2002.

**Cherokee Parks:** He was named after the Cherokee tribe of his great grandmother. As a player, he is most well-known for his college days at Duke where he backed up Christian Laettner during the '92 championship season, the year of the famous [Duke-UK game](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/1992-03-28-duke.html). As a pro, he played for 7 franchises in 9 seasons ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/parksch02.html)).

**Ron Baker:** Baker is a Citizen Potawatomi Nation tribal member and Navarre family descendent who attended Wichita State on a Potawatomi scholarship, joining the Shockers basketball team as a walk-on before honing his shooting to become a key player on their unexpected run to the 2013 Final Four. Despite going undrafted, he played for 3 seasons in the NBA ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bakerro01.html)).

**Kyrie Irving:** Irving is well known to modern NBA fans and is easily the best player on this list (*7x All Star, '12 ROTY, '14 ASG MVP, '16 champion - [career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/irvinky01.html)*). His mother was a Standing Rock Sioux and lived on a reservation before being adopted at a young age. She later died when Kyrie was 4 so he didn't have a connection to this part of his heritage for most of his life, but Kyrie and his sister Asia both joined the tribe at a naming ceremony in 2018.

**Delonte West:** In 2009, West said he's part Piscataway and that his ""REDZ"" tattoo is short for ""Chief Redz"" due to his red hair. He had a 9-year NBA career ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westde01.html)), most notably as the streaky-scoring SG on the '09 Cavs who went to the ECF. West has had some well-documented, post-career mental health issues.

**Aaron Gordon:** According to an interview before his rookie season, Gordon has an Osage Indian great-great-grandfather who was 7 feet tall. Gordon is an athletic and versatile PF with injury issues ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/gordoaa01.html)). He's known for his phenomenal performances as a close runner-up in the 2016 and 2020 Dunk Contests, both of which he arguably coulda/shoulda won, and for his key role on the 2023 champion Nuggets.

**Lindy Waters III:** Waters has a very close connection to both his Kiowa and Cherokee roots. He is from Oklahoma, played at Oklahoma State, and after a year in a couple small pro leagues, he made it to the NBA in February of 2022 with the Oklahoma City Thunder ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/waterli01.html)). He currently plays for the Spurs.

**MarJon Beauchamp:** Beauchamp is a descendent of both the Mission Indians and the La Jolla Band of Luiseno Indians. His backstory is unique and truly inspiring. He was houseless while growing up, went to multiple high schools in Seattle and Arizona, bypassed college to train for the 2021 draft but the gym he was training at shut down due to COVID-19, then he played 12 games at a CC and a season for the G League Ignite, and after success with the Ignite he was drafted 24th overall by the Bucks in 2022 ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/beaucma01.html)). He wore #0 to remind himself that he ""came from nothing"".

**Chance Comanche:** After bouncing around multiple teams in smaller leagues, including the G League, Comanche played a single game with the Trail Blazers, a 56-point loss on the final day of the '23 season ([career stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/comanch01.html)). His paternal grandfather is Native, so Comanche is one-eighth Choctaw and one-eighth Comanche. Most NBA fans who know who he is are only aware that he and his girlfriend were arrested in December of 2023 for the kidnapping and murder of a woman; their trial is expected to begin in 2026.",312,42,2025-11-27,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1p832e8/native_players_in_nba_history/

nba,[Tyrone's Real Fun Statline™] Season finale: 'This came out of nowhere' - least expected players to dominate a statistical category.,"**Tyrone's Real Fun Statline series**

[Episode 10:](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2wx1vm/tyrones_real_fun_statline_only_4_players_had_50/) Who would've expected these guys to get to 50 - the Miller, Brewer, Delk &amp; Ross quartet.

&amp;nbsp;


----

&amp;nbsp;

Haven't done one of these in quite a while, but I promised I would continue the last post and finish the series off so here is the 'season finale'. Episode 10 was all about points; players lighting it up offensively when no one really expected or asked them to do so. Miller, Brewer, Delk and Ross all had 50 point games in seasons in which they averaged less than 15 points. As things stand Mo Williams will join this group as well if he manages to contain his hot shooting streaks (currently sitting at 14.2 ppg). Tribute to Nick Anderson was paid as well, he's the guy whose demolition job against the Nets remains the only time a bench player got to 50 points. 

For this last installment, as a continuation of the previous post, I've decided to expand this research a bit further on a similar note. It's an overview of players who filled up the stat sheet, **but** in categories that they weren't really suppossed or expected to fill up. The resulting statlines could not be seen as compatible with their style of play and were quite surprising, at least for the season in which they've occurred.

&amp;nbsp;

**Have you been up all night watching Magic's highlights?**

George McCloud, one of the most notorious NBA 3-point shooters (averaged [8.6 3PA in 1995-1996](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mccloge01/gamelog/1996/), 2nd most in NBA history), was aware his career is coming to a close, and started questioning himself 'Maybe I should have tried a different approach?'. He started looking for open teammates in [this game](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200103260CHI.html) instead of shooting the ball himself, and ended the game with **22 assists**. In a season in which he averaged only **3.7 assists.** This was truly surprising for McCloud as his career high in assists was 12 and up until then he only had one other 10+ assist game. Channeling his inner Magic actually proved fruitful for his Nuggets as they beat the Bulls (which wasn't really that special of an achievement back in 2001).

One of the more recent examples of players unexpectedly deciding to move the ball as much as possible is Will Bynum. In 2010 [he dished **20 assists**](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201003120DET.html) although he averaged a pretty low number of apg for a point guard that season - only **4.5.** A month before that game he showed everyone what he was capable of by handing out 14 assists, and then 3 years later, in 2013, reminded us of his playmaking capabilites with 12 assists (these are his only 12+ ast games). The fact that the 4.5 apg season was his career high in assists explains why he currently earns his paycheck in China.

**Did Dennis Rodman infiltrate your locker room to give you a lesson on rebounding?**

Just last season Timofey Mozgov averaged only **6.4 rebounds**, although this was mostly affected by his low playing time (10.7 rpg per 36). However, no one really expected this not overly assertive 7'1'' Russian center to explode for a [**29 rebound game**](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201404100GSW.html). Until that point he had only two 15+ rebounding games, so to almost achieve double that number was amazing, despite the increased playing time. The great rebounding performance was, however, completely overshadowed by a [Bryantesque scoring performance](http://imgur.com/r/nba/PUaytm5).

Another player who 'ignored' his season averages and showed he can be a beast on the boards was the relatively unknown Charles Shackleford, who [had a 26](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199002200MIL.html) and a [24 rebound](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199003090NJN.html) games in a span of just 3 weeks, in a season in which he averaged only **6.8 rpg** (11.1 per 36). Through his career he was more of a role player who was a pretty solid rebounder, but it's still a nice feat to quadruple your rebounding averages twice in just a month.

It's also worth mentioning that Joel Pryzbilla, a 15 year NBA veteran with career rebounding average of 6.2 once had a [26 reb game](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200803220LAC.html).

**Did you attend Gary Payton's late night school of pickpocketing?**

You'll remember Brandon Roy for all kinds of things - his incredible scoring ability, heartwrenching injury problems, you name it. But when someone mentions Roy you probably won't immediately think of his defensive awareness, quick hands and ball-stealing prowess. And yet, he is the last player to record **10 steals** in a game. Heck, he's the only player to [record 10 steals](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200901240POR.html) in the last 10 seasons, and only the second one in 15 seasons. Quite surprising really, he only averaged **1.1 steals** in that season and up to that point of his career had only four games with 4+ steals. However, he decided that the Wizards, and particularly Caron Butler (9 TO's) won't have a nice time facing him. 

The second player with 10+ steals in the last 15 seasons is also known more for his scoring and offensive game; you'll remember the 2007 NBA champion Michael Finley. He abused the 76ers back in 2001, taking the ball from them over and over again, until he reached a double-digit number of steals. They lost by a wide margin, but Finley came dangerously close to a quadruple-double (4 reb, 3 ast away) in a season in which he averaged only **1.4 steals**.

**Wait, when did YOU become Kobe?**

There are many situations in which fringe players could decide they are entitled to fire at will and start shooting twice or thrice their normal amount without being reprimanded by their coach, but it usually happens due to **injuries**. An early injury to Chris Bosh in this [Raptors game against the Bucks](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200603260MIL.html) coupled with missings of Jalen Rose, Jose Calderon and Antonio Davis resulted in Charlie Villanueva's playing time skyrocketing to rarely seen heights. He suddenly found himself near the top of the chain of command and he wholeheartedly accepted his new role. Shot after shot, after another shot, and he slowly got to **33 FGA**, tripling his season average of **11.6 FGA**. And he was actually quite efficient in the 46 minutes he got, scoring 48 points. Yes, Charlie Villanueva was once only 2 points shy of a 50 point game. 

An even better example is [Marquis Daniels' 32 point game](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200503070DAL.html) in which he filled the void created by Dirk, Finley and Dampier injuries. It took him **30 shots** to do it, but he has proven that a player who doesn't shoot much at all (**8.4 average FGA** in that season) is able to reinvent his confidence and cover for others in the times of need.

There's also a case of players who are convinced they can contribute by getting hot from beyond the arc, although that is often unwarranted. Eddie Griffin was shooting only **2.5 three pointers per game** making only about third of them but that didn't stop him from firing as much as **15 three-point shots** [in a game](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200412080PHI.html) that season. It was a blowout win, I'll give you that, but it's still odd to decide on having a shooting parade without any backing from the past.

[Matt Barnes' self-entitled performance](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200701030MEM.html), however, cost his team the game. He was shooting **about 4 three's a game** hovering around 35 3P% which isn't all that great, but that didn't stop him from firing **16 shots from behind the 3-point line**. He wasn't particularly efficient, making only 7 of them, ultimately being one of the biggest causes of defeat in this high-scoring affair between Warriors and Grizzlies in 2007.

&amp;nbsp;

There you have it, these are the games I stumbled upon which would probably make you double-check the specific stat  next to the player's name. I left out the blocks section (Keon Clark having 12 blocks, 10 in the first half, in a season in which he averaged 1.9 blocks) and the turnover section (John Lucas 10 turnovers in a 1.5 TO season, Scottie Pippen 12 turnovers in a 2.7 TO/game season) since I didn't find them as unexpected as the other ones.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

This post marks the end of the **Tyrone's Real Fun Statline series**. Hopefully, just the first season of it, since it only covered specific player performances. There's a lot more ideas for research in terms of peculiar and fun player seasons, team seasons, and team games. I have to note that it seems that the general interest for these posts seemed to gradually fade (and, to be honest, my enthusiasm as well), but I hope that those who have read it thoroughly enjoyed them, as did I while making them. The posts sometimes sparked some interesting discussions and conversations, and expanded our knowledge of this beautiful game even further, which was one of the main goals of starting these series. Any additional feedback would be highly appreciated (for example, whether you think that the format and the content is more appropriate for the off-season, which sometimes crossed my mind).

I'm sure that the NBA experience wouldn't be the same without /r/nba so I hope you all enjoy the final portion of the season, as well as the playoffs. Thank you all for reading!

**Current Era Recap** 

Any recap of the present-day Raptors has to link back to when they won their only division crown in 2006-07 (47-35). They lost in the first round that year, but the roster was full of promise, boasting a number one pick in Bargnani, a crew of supporting role players and legitimate star in Chris Bosh (20/10 guy). Things were trending upwards for the Toronto Raptors. 

However, that team failed to get over the hump (the hump being the first round of the playoffs). Instead of getting another star to play with Bosh, former GM Bryan Colangelo threw good money after bad to acquire limited role players (ie: Hedo Turkoglu, Jason Kapono, Fred Jones got multi-year deals). When that didn’t pan out, Colangelo traded for over-the-hill veterans such as Shawn Marion and Jermaine O’Neal, all the while squandering the precious cap space on expensive extensions for his personal favorites (ie: Bargnani, Derozan). This also didn’t work out, as the Raptors failed to even make the playoffs. Finally, due to the team’s ineptitude, Bosh fled for Miami in the dreaded summer of 2010, leaving Toronto with nothing.

Since then, Toronto has “re-tooled”, rather than “rebuilt”. They’ve received numerous lottery picks, but the players have yet to pan out (with the exception of Jonas Valanciunas). They’ve toiled in the bottom of the NBA for the past two seasons. Hoping to save his job, Colangelo traded for Rudy Gay’s huge contract, and he was replaced by former Denver Nuggets GM Masai Ujiri this past off-season. The team is capped out, so there should be little room to sign new players, however Ujiri is known as a wheel-and-deal type of general manager, so expect the team to look pretty different come next off-season. He has already shed Bargnani’s albatross contract on the Knicks for assets. If managed properly, the Raptors’s future looks bright, with new players flanking the budding star that is Jonas Valanciunas in the years to come.

**2012-13 Regular Season Summary** 

[Opening night lineup intro video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgWe0BdTJwY)

[Raptors starting lineup at the end of the season](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JT5UEDDlKw)

Highs and lows of the season:

**Highs**

* The Jonas Valanciunas debut: After waiting a year after drafting him (due to a buyout situation), the Raptors and their fans were finally glad to see their future centre make his debut. Raps fans were surprised to see him show more skill than they had expected in his rookie year, and he has still much more untapped potential.

* Amir Johnson had his best year yet, proving his worth as a valuable starter as well as a great bench player. He was also a candidate for Most Improved Player! Not to mention, he's 26 going into his 9th season in the NBA on a (now) reasonable contract, and he loves the city and gives his all for the team.

* The Rudy Gay trade: Gave Raps fans excitement that we finally had a potential allstar and re-invigorated the team itself. Had a great debut with the team (2 game winners in 3 of his first few games).  He also brought us as close to the playoffs (3 games behind 8th) as possible given the horrible start to the season.

* The Bargnani injury: This might not sound like a good thing... But it was! The Dinos pulled off wins in 8 of the 10 games following the injury to Bargs (including a 5 game win streak!) This was *before* the Rudy Gay trade. This was due, in part, to Ed Davis blossoming as a starter in the absence of the Lazy Italian.

* \#LetRossdunk: The rookie Terrence Ross showed tremendous athleticism in the minutes he played (limited by a stubborn coach), warranting a Slam Dunk contest invitation from the league. His exciting showing at the Dunk Contest earned him the Slam Dunk crown.

**Lows**

* The 4-19 start to the season: The start to the season was a terrible one. 15 of the first 22 were on the road; many of our games were down to the wire but ended up losses; injuries to Lowry, Fields, Kleiza and Anderson; 6 back-to-backs in the first month... and finally a 5 game western conference road stretch that frustrated the team and led to a ""team meeting"". Had it not been for the horrible start, the Raptors would likely have made the playoffs. (Also, ambiguous no-calls from the refs and the 3 ""league apologies"", but we won't get into detail about that... [just check out this Coach Casey post game interview which he got fined 25k for](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBp92IEPcpQ)...)

* Hell or high water: Dwane Casey, after a great first year as a coach in which he introduced a defensive culture, was having a horrible second year. His rotations were horrible, his offensive playbook was non-existent... and he refused to play the young players (Davis, Ross, Valanciunas) many minutes and would sub them out down the stretch in favour of ""the veterans"" (even if the young guys were playing great games). He infamously subbed out Ed Davis down the stretch of one of his best games, for Bargnani who shot 2/19, and in his post game interview said that ""Bargnani is our guy, come [hell or high water](http://i750.photobucket.com/albums/xx144/lillehammer/Turbo_Zone%20Sigs/Turbozone_HellHighWater.jpg)"" which frustrated the fanbase.

* The Rudy Gay trade: Injuries (ongoing back spasms) and (reportedly) bad eyesight as well as inefficient chucking was like a bucket of cold water on Raps fans. And to think we traded one of the most efficient point guards in the league on an expiring contract as well as a PF who was tearing it up as a starter for a huge contract...

* Bargnani's play: After having a great 2012 campaign (almost an allstar if not for injuries), many fans were hopeful that we would see an extension of that good play in the 2013 season. Unfortunately, this season was one of his worst yet, shooting abysmally as well as grabbing less rebounds than even he normally would. On top of that, Bryan Colangelo refused to trade him.

* No draft picks: Since 2013 was reportedly a weak draft, Bryan Colangelo decided to trade our first round pick in the Kyle Lowry trade (and Lowry ended up having a disappointing 2013 campaign) as well as our 2nd rounders in the Rudy Gay and Sebastian Telfair trades.

GM Masai Ujiri's moves this summer have been ambiguous, not pointing to either extreme (summer acquisitions are decent backups, on short and cheap contracts, who could start for a tanking team). With the team currently assembled, expectations are to make the playoffs as a 6th-8th seed and hopefully pull off an upset against a top team, helping change the losing attitude and culture for fans, the players, and potential free agents.

Era recap by /u/unfortunateknicksfan

**Current Era**
Following the limited success of the 1990's, the Knicks went into a dismal downward spiral that coincided with the exodus of the beloved Patrick Ewing and a change in leadership. Saying the 2000's for the Knicks were bad is an understatement. Ineffective management, misguided roster moves and poor cap management left the Knicks with one of the highest player salaries in the league and at the same time one of the worst teams in the league.
Hall of fame coaches came and went, but NYK was unable to do much to stem the its downfall. The front office (led by former Piston Isiah Thomas) filled the roster with a collection of overpaid, troubled players that left the Knicks financially strapped until 2008.

**A new direction**
That was a year of many changes. Isiah was jettisoned from the team (though his presence silently loomed over the team). Respected Pacers GM Donnie Walsh was brought in to helm the front office and former Suns coach Mike D'Antoni was hired to lead the team.
D'Antoni led a misfit team for two seasons as the front office dumped salary to make a run at 2010 free agent LeBron James. Those salary dumps included the contract of Stephon Marbury, who was dismissed from the team in a tumultuous manner.
Finally in 2010, the Knicks signed Amar'e Stoudemire--in an attempt to lure LBJ to NYC. But, as we all know, LeBron eventually decided to skip out on New York and joined Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh in South Beach.
The Knicks made some smaller signings, including Bobcats point guard Raymond Felton, but were unable to secure another star during that free agency period. The Knicks began the next season led by Stoudemire, who put up strong numbers, and led the team to an improved middle-of-the-road record. However, team leaders felt the team need more fire power.
Throughout the season, the Knicks and Nuggets worked to barter a trade for Carmelo Anthony (who made it clear he wanted out of Denver and New York was one of his top destinations).
Prior to the 2010-2011 trade deadline, the Knicks were able to come to an agreement. In a controversial deal that sent a host of young players and picks (including top pick Danilo Gallinari, prospect Wilson Chandler and overperforming Raymond Felton) for Anthony and the aging Chauncey Billups. Some felt the Knicks gave up too much and it's unclear how much Donnie Walsh or D'Antoni liked the move.
Melo joined the team, but there wasn't a marked increase in performance for the Knicks. They rumbled into the playoffs and were quickly dispatched by the the Boston Celtics in the first round. Stoudemire suffered a serious back injury in that series, that would beleaguer the star and be the first of a host of injuries that would haunt his time in NYC. 
There were concerns about Anthony's impact on the team and how well he fit into D'Antoni's system. There were also concerns about the Knicks defensive ability (a stigma that has followed D'Antoni around the league). In an effort to make strides in team defense, the team hired former Hawks coach Mike Woodson as an assistant and brought in center Tyson Chandler from the Mavs. 
Two moves that again went in the face of D'Antoni and his system. The Knicks also chose to amnesty Billups in order to bring in Chandler (after inexplicably signing Billups to an extension during the regular season).
That left the Knicks without a solid option at point guard. The team made some veteran stop gap signings (Baron Davis and Mike Bibby), but neither did much to fill the black hole. Until...

**Linsanity**
D'Antoni went into the lockout shortened season with (injured) Davis, Bibby and troubled prospect Toney Douglas as his main point guard options. But early on the team decided to add another young player to add some depth. That player was Jeremy Lin.
Lin had played his rookie season with the Warriors (spending time in the D-League), but had been waived by them and the Houston Rockets. Lin was projected to spend most of his time on the bench for the Knicks. But the Knicks got off to a poor start and the team was forced to deal with some early injuries. Those injuries led to an opportunity for Lin. He got an early shot in some garbage time games where he played fairly well. 
Then in a game against the New Jersey Nets, Lin went off, scoring 25 points with five rebounds and seven assists.
Lin and the Knicks went on an incredible streak that revived the team and D'Antoni's system. However, the Knicks were unable to keep that momentum throughout the season and the team finished as the seventh seed. A victim of the team's inconsistency was head coach Mike D'Antoni, who resigned mid-season after tensions between D'Antoni and the front office/James Dolan (D'Antoni is rumored to have asked for the team to trade Melo). Assistant Mike Woodson took over and had early success with notable improvement.
However, the Knicks were again dispatched in the first round, this time by the Heat. In the offseason, Lin and another young star (Landry Fields) both left in free agency with the team opting to let the younger talent leave in favor for veteran signings. 

**Last season**
This left the Knicks trying to build around Carmelo Anthony, as Stoudemire was still plagued with injuries. Melo made a move to power forward and Woodson altered his offense into a D'Antoni-esque system that proved to be quite effective early on. The Knicks showed improvement and won some big games in impressive fashion. However, one again, the Knicks were unable to maintain that momentum and floundered in the second half of the season. 
In the playoffs, they were able to pass the Boston Celtics in the first round, but were grinded down by the Indiana Pacers in a (frankly) hard-to-watch series.

/u/SreeG's expectations:
After having one of the most successful seasons in recent history for the Knicks, a lot of individuals wrote us off for the upcoming season due to roster enhancements from other teams in the East. I don’t think we’re going to fall, I think we’re still going to be one of the better teams in the East. I’ve heard a lot of criticism for our offseason, but I still can’t understand what made it so “bad.” I’d like to remind everyone that Glen Grunwald barely had any wriggle room, and still managed to upgrade our roster. We re-signed JR Smith, the reigning sixth man of the year. A large part of his lackluster playoff performance was due to knee troubles, and while some of you may go “why would you pay so much money to someone coming off of a knee injury?” He was the only person we could have spent that money on; besides, Glen Grunwald even said that things are looking optimistic for JR Smith’s recovery. In other news, we resigned Kenyon Martin, and Pablo Prigioni, who were big for us in the later part of the year. We also drafted Tim Hardaway Jr., and signed Jeremy Tyler, and CJ Leslie, who are young talents that could grow into solid players. The two bigger signings in the offseason were Metta World Peace, and Andrea Bargnani. Metta was amnestied by the Lakers, and the Knicks were immediate front-runners in acquiring him. Metta still has a lot in the tank, his defense, and scoring should definitely be a huge boost to us in the regular, and post season. Now, here is the person who receives a lot of criticism, Andrea Bargnani. I can understand the hate; he didn’t play like a #1 pick should, he doesn’t rebound well for a seven footer, etc. But, I think he’ll play much better in New York than he did in Toronto the previous year. I saw this stat somewhere stating Andrea did better in away games than home games; think of that in whatever way you want. In New York, he isn’t expected to carry the offense, he doesn’t have the pressure of playing like a #1 draft pick, and he never had someone as talented as Carmelo Anthony to play with. I’ve also heard that we gave up too much for him, and I don’t think that’s true. We gave up Steve Novak, Marcus Camby, Q-Rich, and some draft picks. While Novak was decent in the regular season, he was nowhere to be seen in the playoffs. Marcus Camby, and Q-Rich barely played in any games for us, so they didn’t mean much. I know the draft picks might seem a little excessive, but we basically traded Denver’s draft pick (they have the ability to switch with us), and two second rounder’s. Personally, I can’t wait for the season, because I think we had one hell of an offseason. While the other teams in the East have improved, I think the Knicks are still capable of getting a top seed, and going deep into the playoffs. #Knickstape.

nba,"A Look Into LeBron's Summer: Every Potential LeBron landing spot and why I DON'T think it is limited to only Cleveland, Philly, LA or Houston w/ Explanations (Pretty Long Read but Worth It)","So after another night of watching LeBron go helplessly up against the modern day version of the Monstars, I decided to get drunk and make a list of potential destinations I think LeBron could realistically go to this summer. 

I am a Sixers fan so I do have a dog in this race, but just as an overall NBA fan foremost I present these thoughts unbiasedly as more than anything I just want to see competitive basketball again. You guys will probably not agree with all of them, maybe laugh at a few and probably think I'm playing 2k MyGM about others, but as the NBA subreddit I would enjoy nothing more than just healthy conversations in the comments about potential rosters, fits, and payroll structures and I will try my best to logically explain all of them as best I can because I really do (some more so than others and some needing a few things to admittedly fall into place) think that they all could be realistic spots. 

I really do think he has a lot of options--even more than the ""consensus 4"" that the media are trying to say he is considering (being Cleveland, Philly, Houston and LA). I am of the mind that if LeBron really wanted to play on a team and gave them a verbal, they could make some moves to make it happen--it's just easier to say teams like the Sixers or the Lakers because the max slot is basically already there but I do think others are contenders as well. I can make the case for a boatload of teams to be honest with you and I think LeBron will have a ton of options to sift through.

But I will start with the 'Consensus 4' because they are indeed the easiest to explain and figure, I just don't think Bron is already tied down to those four. 

**Cleveland**- The Cavs obviously appeal more so than any team in the league to LeBron emotionally, but that's really about it. When you look at their roster right now it is clear that LeBron is just about the only thing holding them together and without him they are probably a lottery team. However it wasn't always like this. I think it goes without saying that losing Kyrie was a crucial blow to this Cleveland team--especially when you get nothing worth noting for him in return. Compound that with the bad long-term contracts they have (George Hill, Tristan Thompson, JR Smith, Jordan Clarkson) and there isn't really much hope moving forward for them to get better in the way that they would need to to be beat Golden State 2.0 with Durant. 

I honestly feel pretty bad for Cleveland, as I think that they got some pretty bad breaks along the way since LeBron returned. In 2015 the first year, Kevin Love and Kyrie go down and your 2nd best player is Matthew Dellavedova going up a vulnerable, inexperienced, young Warriors team in the Finals that I think you could have beat if healthy. 2016 was the only year I personally thought the deck was stacked evenly but in the end nobody really cares about my opinion. So they win that year and not even a month goes by before the team that you just barely beat adds in my mind the 2nd best player in the league to an already historic 73-9 team. So without much surprise Golden State steamrolls Cleveland in the 2017 Finals. The Cavs went into that offseason with the mindset that if they can just get a little better (aka Kevin Love/Paul George trade) then they can compete with the Warriors and be on an equal ground with them. However not only did that trade not happen, you then had your 2nd best player Kyrie Irving and a guy you thought you had fully committed and bought in demand a trade in which Cleveland capitulated and traded Kyrie to their main Eastern Conference contender in a move that still baffles me. 

And so, you have the Cavs team today. I'd be lying if I said I didn't think they had some interesting pieces, but nothing near the superstar talent that you need to match up with a Warrior team that adds a force like KD. I think if LeBron was to commit you could potentially flip that Brooklyn pick for a guy like Kemba Walker or maybe even add Thompson in and have Charlotte add Dwight Howard but even then I still don't think that can push the Warriors. No matter what you do with the Brooklyn pick (their most valuable non-LeBron asset) the Cavs are still going to be capped out with bad contracts that no teams want without a tangible way to get better on the level that you need to be to run with Golden State.

But again, Bron's decision may not be about competing with Golden State and championships, that's where Cleveland could push the emotion and loyalty angle. Small things like seeing his son's attend his alma mater and finishing out his career as a Cav are things he has to consider as well as his families overall comfortability and happiness but from a roster standpoint the Cavs do leave a lot to be desired but the one thing they have working for them over every other team is that they are the only one that can claim him as his home. 

**Philadelphia**- Now that the Bryan Colangelo saga is over I can finally go back to resuming my life and being happy about my team. That in itself may be selling point, as if the Sixers hire a guy like David Griffin to replace Colangelo that will assuringly catch LeBron's attention. 

The main thing about Philly is that obviously the money is there but you also get to stay in the East and have an easier road to the Finals, on an up and coming team with 2 legit superstars, potentially a 3rd (yes I am the lead driver of the Markelle Fultz bandwagon--hop on before we fill up for next season) and a very solid bunch of role players in Saric, Covington, McConnell (and potentially Redick, Bellinelli and Ilyasova at discounts). You have the 10th pick in the draft as well which is another asset with noting (s/o Hinkie). 

You aren't tied down to these guys either, if Bron was to come and a Kawhi Leonard was to become available Philly would have the assets to go get him and keep much of their core. With some paperwork you may even be able to match the Lakers and create 2 max slots and pair Bron with PG (trade Covington who is on a team friendly deal, pair the Bayless contract with pick #26) and the Sixers young core. 

Or you could just add LeBron and watch this young core grow. As Bron gets older Ben, Joel, Kelle and the crew will start to come into their own and the pressure won't be on Bron to do nearly as much as he has to do currently in Cleveland. I think most would say that it's going to be between Boston and Philly in the East for the foreseeable future unless something crazy happens so I think Bron will definitely take that into consideration when making his decision. If the reports are true that LeBron wants to play the final stretch of his career a lot more 'off of the ball' there is not a better player you could ask for then Ben Simmons. From a purely basketball sense Philly makes all the sense in the world, but it won't be the only option or clear cut choice. I can sleep well at night knowing that either way we'll be okay (unless our new GM has multiple burners, Markelle never learns how to shoot or Ben knocks up Kendall). Regardless 'The Process' 30 for 30 will be one for the ages.

**Los Angeles**- If nothing else the Lakers certainly present the easiest option to explain for LeBron. By simply renouncing Randle they will open up 2 max slots for presumably LeBron and Paul George. Add those 2 All Stars to last years surprising young core of Ingram, Kuzma, Hart and Ball and you have something to work with if you're the Lakers. 

And if you really want to make a splash if everyone could agree to take a haircut on the contracts you could maybe talk a Chris Paul into joining the Lakers as well. The Lakers have the most money and flexibility so their options are predominately noted from this free agent class. 

They got lucky by striking on Kuzma--who looks like he's going to be a stud. Ingram has taken some strides and if Ball can add some muscle and start hitting his shot consistently you have a good young group. The question would then become to how they would fill out their roster and their bench as well as their center position? But you could do a whole lot worse than a core of LeBron, Paul George, Kuzma, Ingram and Lonzo. 

And in a market like LA and a team headlined by LeBron I could foresee a bunch of guys wanting to join that group and taking less to play there.

Another thing worth noting in addition to the roster is LeBron's highly publicized ties to LA. He already has 2 homes out there so the transition would be more seamless than just about any other place besides Cleveland. LA really honestly sells itself but in addition to the location, Bron's primary business opportunities take place out there. 

And then there is the the whole branding of being a Laker and joining the tradition. As well as the reverence he would get if he was the one to lead a Laker team back to glory. All arbitrary things, but when you're main goal is chasing Jordan, these points carry weight.

**Houston**- The Rockets in my mind present the best 'win right now' opportunity. I don't think I need to explain how much damage a trio of LeBron James, James Harden and Chris Paul could do if paired together. The idea of it potentially not working is a joke to me as well. They all want to win, and are all unselfish players. They each can take a burden off of each other and help elevate each other. 

Although admittedly it would take Daryl Morey a lot of maneuvering to make it work and Houston would stand to lose a lot of their key role-players. 

Personally I am not buying the report that Chris Paul will only accept the max. I think that he is so desperate for a ring and after another year deflated by a heartbreaking injury I think he will do whatever he has to make it work if LeBron gave him the verbal that he wanted to come down to Houston. If he wasn't going to accept anything less than the max then he wouldn't be actively recruiting LeBron right now. If he was primarily motivated by the money he would have taken the super-max the Clippers offered him last summer. He left millions on the table to uproot his family and move down to Houston with one goal in mind, to win a championship. 

But even if they were able to fit that Big 3 in Houston the rest of their roster becomes cloudy. Houston would benefit greatly if they found a suitor for Ryan Anderson's contract. Maybe if they attached a sum of draft picks to it a tanking team will bite. Clearing Anderson's contract makes it a hell of a lot easier, as Gordon, Ariza and Tucker are all at reasonable numbers.

I think if LeBron was to come to Houston, Capela would probably be the biggest cap casualty as I think he is about to get maxed during the summer by some team. Athletic rim-protectors don't grow on trees but they aren't as hard to find as a once-in-a-generation player in LeBron James so for me the choice would be easy. 

You add Bron to Harden and CP, you have a series for the ages with Golden State, presumingly in the conference finals.

Those are 4 teams that are being widely reported that LeBron will choose from in July. It has been spread around so much that people have for the most part stopped considering any other alternatives. I don't buy that at all. When a clearly frustrated LeBron James hits the open market, if you have any semblance of a 'win-now' team you are going to reach out and try to figure out what it would take to get him to join your team. Although those 4 may admittedly be the front-runners, I by no means think that they are the only options. I think a couple of teams could elevate themselves into the LeBron conversation with a couple housecleaning moves I will outline below. 

**That said, I think there are 5 additional teams LeBron would seriously consider signing with if a couple things were to fall into place for them:**

**Boston**- Yes that Boston, the team with Kyrie Irving. It makes me sick to say this but I think Boston could be a realistic possibility. I may be the only person who thinks this but I do think what happened with him and Kyrie was just one big miscommunication. 

If Ainge was serious about getting LeBron, I think he could get Kyrie and Bron to sit in a room and hash it out and come to an agreement. FWIW they looked pretty damn cool at the All Star Game together, almost shockingly cool like nothing ever happened (https://giphy.com/gifs/nba-fun-basketball-1g2WBCkBRcRIjIsvOf). Looks just like old times no? Sorry Cavs fans

And honestly I thought LeBron and Kyrie complemented each others games absolutely beautifully. If Bron wanted to go to Boston and Ky gave his approval, Boston could easily flip the Hayward contract (say a Utah reunion for a couple of future draft picks) and renounce Smart and you'd have the money for Bron giving them a lineup that could really go up against GS.

I think Kyrie would feel a whole hell of a lot more comfortable being on a team with LeBron that he has no front office control or influence over. LeBron basically owned the Cavs these past 4 years, so if he ever wanted to flip Kyrie for Chris Paul he could have probably made that happen with a wave of his hand. He will have no such influence in Boston, and I think that would make Kyrie feel a lot better about the possible reunion. 


That team would be the 2017 Cavs on steroids. LeBron and Kyrie reunite, Al Horford basically takes over the Kevin Love role but with better playmaking and rim protection. And supplementing JR Smith and Tristan Thompson in the lineup with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown is like going from a 4 to an 8. Terry Rozier instantly becomes the best bench player KyBron have ever played with and I haven't even mentioned the coaching upgrade of going to Brad Stevens from Tyronn Lue. 

The only thing is I think it would be weird as hell to see LeBron in a Celtics jersey, but I think it is way more possible than people actually consider. I really think Bron and Kyrie can make amends. 

**Oklahoma City**- I think OKC could be another one but I do think it would require a lot more work. Anybody who watched the Thunder consistently this past year knows that their REAL 'Big 3' was Russ, PG and Steven Adams. 

The thing that hurts them is that they traded for 34 year old Carmelo Anthony and not 27 year old Carmelo Anthony. He is obviously going to accept his Player Option because nobody else is going to give him anywhere near $28 mill a year to shoot 3/15. 

If they could by the grace of god find a trade partner to take on Melo's $28 mill by packaging a Brooklyn Nets amount of draft picks to a tanking team I think OKC becomes a legit contender for Bron's services. 

If he really wants to team up with PG, the conversation would be had would you rather do it with the young guys in LA or add another superstar in Westbrook along with one of the most underrated players in the game in Steven Adams, and defensive ace Andre Roberson in OKC. 

That starting 5 could go up against Golden State and give you a potential WCF of Westbrook vs. Durant for all the marbles that people have wanted to see ever since KD left. 

Note: This all sounds great, but I just remembered that Melo still has a guaranteed No Trade Clause. That obviously complicates things. Maybe they can threaten to not play him at all this season if he doesn't waive his trade clause. But in hindsight Presti trading Kanter for Melo may have costed OKC a serious chance at not only getting LeBron but retaining Paul George. Another example of why you should always keep the long view (s/o Hinkie again). I'll leave everything I wrote because in the 1% chance it happens it would be a hell of a story. Plus Melo can get like 20 shots a night in Sacramento or some shit haha.

**San Antonio**- I think San Antonio offers an argument as well, but only if they can show LeBron that they have cleared up the Kawhi situation. 

At this point in Bron's career you couldn't ask for a better archetype to have as a coach in Gregg Poppovich and a running mate in Kawhi Leonard, a guy who can take all of the defensive assignments and score on all 3 levels. Essentially the Scottie Pippen to LeBron's Jordan. 

This would all be predicated on Kawhi getting fully healthy and accepting the super-max San Antonio will offer him this offseason. I think stability for LeBron will be paramount this time around so if they can do these things I think the Spurs actually become realistic. 

The complementary pieces aren't bad, you can either go with them or try to deal them to maybe clear space for another guy (Chris Paul?) to maybe join with you and form a Big 3. TP and Ginobili will almost assuredly take less to make that work and come off the bench if LeBron was serious about coming there and Kawhi was serious about staying. (Take note Melo).

**Miami**- I put Miami on the list as the biggest long shot but do it out of respect to Dwyane Wade and Pat Riley. This one would almost certainly be a narrative type play. 

But the facts are LeBron is magnet and LeBron in Miami sounds a lot more attractive to prospective free agents than LeBron in Cleveland. I view this as the least possible out of the ones I mentioned because I honestly don’t know how Riley would make the contracts work. Miami has some pretty bad deals but if Riley can get out from an under a Whiteside deal, a Tyler Johnson deal, and a James Johnson deal then you might have something. 

Miami has a solid supporting cast but this would be like another Cleveland like situation of LeBron dragging another cap-stricken team to the Finals just to get blown out by Golden State. 

But if Pat Riley can find a way to create some flexibility if you are LeBron I think you would have to grant them a meeting out of respect and hear his pitch out. Like LA, if Miami can create the flexibility it instantly becomes a hotbed for free agents and prospective players.

**New Orleans**- New Orleans is interesting because they basically played without a Small Forward last year. In a perfect world you can just drop LeBron in their lineup at the 3 and you have a unique blend of lock down guards and athletic bigs that could not only keep up with Golden State on defense but probably dominate them on the boards and in the post. 

But it’s not a perfect world. In order to get LeBron, New Orleans would almost assuredly have to sacrifice something. Whether that be AD (not happening), Jrue Holiday or most likely Boogie. Unless one of those guys decides to be an angel and take a really nice pay cut (probably not going to happen either) 1 of them and probably a guy like Solomon Hill or Mirotic is going to have to go. But assuming it would be Boogie (amplified because he will be free anyway) and you could find a trade partner to take on the Hill contract backed with picks, you would get a very interesting roster. 

Bron and AD together would be absolutely insane and hell to guard. I think Jrue Holiday shocked a numerous amount of people with his play in the playoffs. And to top it all of you would have Playoff Rondo running the show at the point as maybe the best pure facilitator in the NBA over the past 8-10 years. If you can supplement that lineup with shooting you have something offensively and defensively that could seriously push the Warriors.

The common theme here is the Warriors. The NBA fan in me selfishly wants to see LeBron make his decision based on going to a team that will seriously provide competition to the Warriors. I was pretty depressed when KD went to Golden State because I knew there wasn't going to be competition. But if Bron can counter it by making another Golden State somewhere else (even if it's not in Philly) and give us an epic Finals or WCF matchup of 2 basically All-Star teams I will take it.

 I think all these teams have their pros and cons. But I do think (some with a little more massaging then others) are all realistic under the right circumstances. I think the media is trying to push a narrative that it is down to ‘these 4 teams’ (CLE, PHI, LAL, HOU) that I frankly don’t agree with and I just wanted to chime in with some scenarios. 

To others some of these scenarios may be completely unrealistic but I just wanted to share my opinion and lay out some ideas that I think could have some legs to them. Regardless of any of their validities it sure will be an interesting summer. If KD did anything besides ruin the NBA it was he sure made the offseason’s fun. Anyway thanks for reading and God Bless!",246,220,2018-06-08,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8pjup2/a_look_into_lebrons_summer_every_potential_lebron/

##2013-14 Regular Season Recap
 


Coming off a first round exit to the OKC Thunder, the Houston Rockets were poised to make another step forward the next year with additional seasoning and added chemistry. With all that going for them, the Rockets managed to signed Dwight Howard away from the Los Angeles Lakers. Combining Howard with one of the league's best offense spelled doom for the rest of the league.

Unfortunately, the season started off a little chaotic. Mchale tried to incorporate Asik and Howard together to form a ""Twin Towers"" look and despite winning games early in the season, the offense was troubling. Poor spacing led to too many forced shot from Harden and Howard, lack of chemistry each night turned 3-4 alley-oops to [alley-whoops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw_Qdnnetsg#t=190), and too many leads given up in the fourth quarter had people wondering if this was a part of the ""Dwightmare"" package. 

However, as some time passed the team began to gel. Terrence Jones was inserted into the starting line up for the ""injured"" Omer Asik and was instrumental in creating better spacing on the floor and movement off the ball. Chandler Parsons stepped up his game offensively and became the secondary ball-handler among the starting unit. Patrick Beverley remained a pest on defense earning him (with much scrutiny) a spot on the 2nd all-defensive team. Jeremy Lin played his role admirably, being the spark off the bench and at times finishing the game at SG with Beverley playing the point and Harden shifting to SF. 

The Rockets really hit their stride in February and March going into April. Led by the brilliant play of Harden, Howard, and co. The team's chemistry managed to shine through highlighted by their notable wins over the Heat, the Pacers ([Harden Super Saiyen game](http://reactiongifs.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/james-harden-houston-rockets-super-saiyan.gif), and the crazy comeback win over the Trailblazers featuring [clutch Harden in the 4th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=cBDZnCcWL1Y#t=98).

The season was not without scrutiny however. The addition of Dwight Howard came with a lot of baggage. Most of which stemmed from media disdain and fan disapproval from the largest NBA fanbase in the world. With the added eyeballs eyeing hungrily for the Rockets to slip up and fail, several items made its rounds. A viral video of Harden's defense circulated the news and social media. Omer Asik demanding to be traded. Donatas Motiejunas complaining about playing time. Scrutiny of Mchale's offense, Howard's post moves, etc. Coupled with Mchale's ""treatment"" of Jeremy Lin caused another giant fanbase to lash out against the Rockets. 

Despite all the social media distractions and criticism, the Rockets' chemistry was improving and it looked like there was a chance to challenge the 3rd seed. Then Howard missed some games with a minor injury and Beverley went down with a meniscus tear. The team lost the momentum gained from a strong March and managed to limp into the playoffs, not knowing whether or not Beverley would be able to play much less start. 
 
 
 
##Playoffs
 
* Beverley did not elect to have surgery and went on to start, but did not have tenacity as he had most of the season due to his injury

* Terrence Jones' was destroyed on defense by Lamarcus Aldridge in the first two games and ended up being a non-factor

* Harden was a no-show for all of the playoffs. Portland defended him well, but Harden's shot wasn't falling enough to warrant playing him tight on the perimeter. 

* Lin played okay. Had one good game leading to a victory, but several costly plays throughout the playoffs (notably being stripped by Mo Williams in the waning seconds of the game while holding a lead)

* Parsons played inconsistently. Claiming to be the best SF in the series only to be shown up in second halves.

* Bench, nonexistent. Troy Daniels with an unforgettable shot to seal a victory earned him additional playing time and greater confidence moving forward

* Asik worked hard on defense against Aldridge and that's all you could really ask from him. His picks will be missed.

* Howard played like he did back with the Orlando Magic. No, the Rockets were not able to advance, but it was not because of Howard. He played his ass off and was the lone force on offense and defense with any consistency. 

* Lillard. *sigh*

##2014-2015

Thanks, /u/risinglotus for the write up!

Any off-season with Daryl Morey as your GM is going to be an interesting one, unfortunately, interesting was about the only thing the Rockets had going for themselves. After making huge pushes for both **Bosh** and **Melo**, the Rockets not only those two opportunities and the fans trust in [Wojnarowski](https://twitter.com/WojYahooNBA/status/487642323174846465), they also lost their young, inexpensive stud in **Chandler Parsons** to [Mark Cuban's](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100702150413/simpsons/images/6/6a/Mr_Burns_evil.gif) Mavericks. 

The bench also got (somehow) weaker, with **Lin** and **Asik** being traded to make room for a max contract (and to appease **Asik**). Fortunately for the Rockets, the **Parsons** wound was sealed by **Ariza** and his surprisingly reasonable contract. Whilst the 14/15 Rockets will miss **Parsons** and his driving and passing abilities (amongst other, less-basketball related [things](http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/OS6Tr7xs0iiL7YBt04.h.A--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/blogs/sptusnbaexperts/181286835.jpg.jpg)), **Ariza** will provide much needed improvements in defense and three point shooting.

The drafting of **Clint Capela** and **Nick Johnson** as well as the signing of European stud **Kostas Papanikolaou** provides the Rockets with exciting prospects, however in Rockets tradition, they will spend a substantial time in the D-League until they show they can produce consistent NBA talent. The other off-season acquirements don't exactly strike fear into opponents with **Jeff Adrien**, **Joey Dorsey**, **Jason Terry** and **Ish Smith** and it shows what will probably the Rockets main issue for the upcoming season; it's bench. The bench will consist of players with inexperience or players who haven't consistently contributed to teams (minus **Terry**). The great hope of the Rockets fan is that major development will occur in our sophomore and third year guys in **Donatas Motiejunas** , **Isaiah Caanan** and **Troy Daniels** and a potential resurgence in re-signed veteran **Francisco Garcia**. 

I would talk about the Rockets offense that would likely be run this upcoming season, but there may not be such a thing, as former assisstant coach Kelvin Sampsons put it ""learning the playbook is not an issue, because Houston doesn't really have a playbook."" This is **Kevin McHale's** last year of his contract, so if improvements are not shown to the team's defensive and offensive playbook, he may not return next season.  

Despite the loss of **Parsons**, **Lin** and **Asik**, fans remain hopeful. Another year of **Harden** and **Howard** together, **Ariza's** (and hopefully **Harden's**) improvement to the team defense and the continual development of **Jones** and **Beverley** provides hope that the team can reach around the same win total of last years with 54 wins. And while the season plays out, Morey will be lurking, with the Harden-trade-like assets already starting to gather, he'll continue on with his third superstar hunt.

--: 	|	:--	|	:--	|	:-:	|	:--	|
1.	|	[](/GSW) Warriors	|	--	|	14-2	|	The Warriors have been perfect since the last rankings, riding a 9 game win streak and going 5-0 on a road trip for only the 2nd time in franchise history. This was in jeopardy in both OKC and Charlotte, but the 6th ranked player in PER saved them a couple of times. I'm of course talking about Marresse Speights, who scored 28 and 27 points in those games respectively. However, they will be heavily tested over the next several weeks with games vs. NOP x2, CHI, HOU, DAL, MEM, and OKC, many of which are on the road.	|
2.	|	[](/MEM) Grizzlies	|	--	|	15-2	|	The Grizzlies have gone 6-1 since the last update. The team started strong with a 26 point home win over the Houston Rockets, who were on a SEGABABA. Their sole lose was at the Raptors where 2 starters and 3 rotation players were missing due to illness (Mike Conley's backup, callup Kalin Lucas of the Iowa Energy, didn't arrive to the stadium until after introductions). The Grizzlies still put up a solid fight against the leading team in the East before falling by 4 points. The Grizzlies bounced back from the virus for a solid win over Boston and a huge home win over their rivals, the Clippers. The Grizz then had a succesfull 3-0 west coast road trip, with solid wins over the Lakers, Kings, and the Trailblazers (who were on a 9 game winning streak). Marc Gasol's quiet MVP quest continues as he averages 25pts/9rb/4ast/1.5blks on 60.5% shooting and 91.7% FT the last 5 games. Courtney Lee has provided reliable scoring, averaging 13.3 pts with a TS% of 66.6%	|
3.	|	[](/SAS) Spurs	|	+7	|	12-4	|		|
4.	|	[](/POR) Trailblazers	|	+3	|	13-4	|	Winners of 10 of their last 11, with their only loss coming at the hands of Memphis. This week will be a test for them, as they take to the road in ernest for the first time.	|
5.	|	[](/HOU) Rockets	|	-2	|	13-4	|	The injury bug has bit hard for Houston, with Beverley, Jones, Howard and now Caanan all out for an indefinite amount of time. An impressive win when shorthanded against Dallas as well as comfortable wins against New York and the much improved Milwaukee has allowed Houston to maintain it's great record, but without three starters and the backup PG, Houston may soon struggle. 	|
6.	|	[](/DAL) Mavericks	|	--	|	13-5	|	Dallas went 6-2 since the last published power rankings. However, they played a lot of easy teams, and after blowing out the Lakers, they went a week of barely beating teams, or losing, that they should have won big against. Felton has served his suspension, so the bench got a slight upgrade. The team needs these 2 days off, since they face a brutal December schedule that'll show how good this Dallas team really is.	|
7.	|	[](/TOR) Raptors	|	-3	|	13-4	|	As Toronto fans know, even when things are going well you should be wary. During a tough loss to Dallas, Demar Derozan went down with injury and his timetable for a return has not been defined. That along with an unfortunate loss to the Lakers marred what was an otherwise excellent two weeks, going 5-2. Losing Demar hurts but it shoudln't be for too long and the Raptors' depth will allow them to stay competitive. This west coast trip will tell us a lot of how far this Raps team might go this year. 	|
8.	|	[](/CHI) Bulls	|	-4	|	11-6	|	The Bulls have had a road heavy schedule which saw them play 7 consecutive games away from the UC, after which they emerged with an 11-6 record. Injuries made the Circus Trip even tougher than usual but the Bulls went out on a high note with a blowout victory in Brooklyn. They look forward to 4 out of their next 5 games being at home, especially with their starting 5 healthy.	|
9.	|	[](/LAC) Clippers	|	+2	|	11-5	|	Perhaps the Clippers' early season struggles had more to do with a shooting slump than we thought. They've been lights out over the past few weeks, and although they're still underwhelming against some elite teams they've rebounded quite nicely. After an unprecedented 6-1 road swing (with three SEGABABAs), they've got a very favorable schedule for the next few weeks, so next time we check in they may very well be back in the top five.	|
10.	|	[](/WAS) Wizards	|	-1	|	10-5	|	The Wizards schedule toughened up with 6 straight games against .500 and over teams. The return of Beal helped as they went 3-3 in those games. John Wall remains the most consistent player on the team averaging 18 points 9 assists. Porter and Butler continue to be great options of the bench. 	|
11.	|	[](/CLE) Cavaliers	|	-3	|	8-7	|	The Cavaliers notched their third straight win on Saturday over the Pacers. The Cavs’ offense has shown signs of brilliance at times, especially when the Cavs’ starters are on the floor. The Cavs’ bench has provided much less consistent scoring, often allowing teams to get back into games after the Big 3 get them out to an early lead.	|
12.	|	[](/ATL)  Hawks	|	+4	|	9-6	|	""Despite a two game stretch of miserable losses (CLE, LAL) the Hawks are 7-3 in their last 10. A stretch equaled in the East by only Toronto. Though they lost to those Raptors it was a good week for Atlanta beating the Wiz then mostly quieting AD in another win. Toss in that they're soaring up the attendance ladder and MVTeague isn't even in his final form and you've got a good looking Hawks team right now.  ""	|
13.	|	[](/PHX) Suns	|	+2	|	10-8	|	The Suns had the perfect opportunity to improve their record during an easy eastern conference road trip. However, after going 4-0 on the east coast, the team dropped 2 of its last 3 (and neither loss was against a playoff team). On the bright side, Isaiah Thomas will likely be back soon after missing three games with an ankle injury.	|
14.	|	[](/SAC) Kings	|	-2	|	9-8	|	The Sacramento Kings finished their tough November schedule above .500 even though they had injuries plague them. Darren Collison and Rudy Gay missed the same two games, and after their return, DeMarcus Cousins missed the last two games. Kings look to take advantage of their easier schedule in December and finish the year off strong!	|
15.	|	[](/MIA) Heat	|	-1	|	9-7	|		|
16.	|	[](/DEN) Nuggets	|	+11	|	8-8	|	After a 2-7 start, the Nuggets have rallied to win 6 out of the last 7 games, including a 5 game win streak against the likes of the Bulls, Pelicans, and Cavaliers. Ty Lawson has led the team during that stretch, putting up a cool 17 pts and 12 asts per game. With an established 10 man rotation, Brian Shaw's seat has cooled off considerably, and the Nuggets are right back in the West playoff hunt.	|
17.	|	[](/MIL) Bucks	|	+2	|	10-8	|	Ersan's move to the bench has helped him bring his efficiency back to his contract year numbers while opening up minutes for an ever improving Giannis. Mayo has finally supplanted Duds as well. However, losing two thirds of the three headed Frankencenter is really exposing our lack of size as the schedule tightens.	|
18.	|	[](/NOP) Pelicans	|	-5	|	7-8	|	New Orleans has dropped 3 straight since Eric Gordon's injury. That should tell you about everything you need to know.	|
19.	|	[](/OKC) Thunder	|	+4	|	5-12	|	In his return game, Westbrook scored 32 points/8 assists/7 rebounds/1 steal in just 24 minutes of play—helping the Thunder win two consecutive games for the first time this season. Look for the Thunder to gradually improve its record as more players (Durant, Jones, McGary) return from injuries this month.	|
20.	|	[](/IND) Pacers	|	+2	|	7-10	|	Another interesting two weeks for the Pacers as they rack up an impressive road win against Dallas, look strong in a loss to San Antonio, and also get clobbered at home by Phoenix...all of this without star big man Roy Hibbert. With West and Watson returning, there's more scoring for Indiana, and Hibbert returning can help solidify the defense.	|
21.	|	[](/BKN) Nets	|	-4	|	6-9	|		|
22.	|	[](/ORL) Magic	|	+2	|	7-12	|	The Orlando Magic lead the entire league in not only games played, but road games played, and still hold a respectable record at 7-12. On top of that, their next 5 games are also on the road against tough opponents. The usual suspects have continued to play well, with Payton being a huge spark off the bench. The team is learning to finally win on the road and the record should start improving once they get past this brutal portion of their schedule.	|
23.	|	[](/UTA) Jazz	|	-2	|	5-12	|	As the Jazz have lost five in a row, the luster is wearing off the new season somewhat. We are happy Gordon Hayward is making plays, he's been looking really good and his game is nice too. The Jazz love to fall down like 17 pts in the first then claw back, which means they are competitive, since they do usually claw back in--but still to inconsistent to beat good teams.	|
24.	|	[](/BOS) Celtics	|	-4	|	4-10	|	There's no sugar coating going 1-5 over the past two weeks so the Celtics have to drop. A long stretch of winnable games in December will decide if the C's should be in the 19-24 or 25-29 range.	|
25.	|	[](/MIN) TWolves	|	+3	|	4-11	|	Wolves put up only 2 wins (against the Knicks and the Lakers) since the last time we ranked them but the Wolves once again lost another starter to boo-boos as Kevin Martin went down with a wrist injury. With the rest of the starters and most of the vets out the Wolves have been relying heavily on their youth. This has brought hope for the team as the Wolves have the highest and second highest points in a game among rookies.	|
26.	|	[](/NYK) Knicks	|	-1	|	4-14	|		|
27.	|	[](/CHA) Hornets	|	-9	|	4-14	|	[Submitted without further comment.](http://gfycat.com/HeartfeltGloomyIndianrhinoceros)	|
28.	|	[](/LAL) Lakers	|	+1	|	4-13	|	The Lakers are giving a much better effort in every game and I think much of that has to do with having another guy on the team that can create their own shot in Nick Young. The ball movement is much better all around though the offense still gets stagnant with ball watching far too often. The defense is still pretty terrible and Ed Davis still deserves more minutes. There doesn't seem to be an actual offensive plan and the defensive plan is garabage. Other than the blowout in Dallas we've been competitive in all the recent games too.	|
29.	|	[](/DET) Pistons	|	-3	|	3-14	|	The Pistons have no leader, no one who can, will, or wants to take over a game when the going gets tough. They often hang with their opponent until midway through the 3rd quarter and then they fall apart. Its hard to continue to be optimistic when the Pistons have lost 8 games in a row and show no sings of improvement.	|
30.	|	[](/PHI) 76ers	|	--	|	0-16	|	Welp. MCW's return has been quite disappointing and Tony Wroten is out of the lineup with a strained knee. On the bright side Noel has been putting in some really decent games and KJ McDaniels has proven that he needs as many minutes as he can handle. MCW's shooting will come around and with games against MIN and DET that first win could be right around the corner!	|",238,226,2014-12-01,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2nyha7/official_rnba_power_rankings_rankings_3_1212014/

**Derrick Rose Era**

With only a 1.7% chance of winning the 2008 NBA Draft Lottery the Chicago Bulls won and selected Derrick Rose first overall. The Bulls made the playoffs the next two seasons led by a core of Rose, Luol Deng, and Kirk Hinrich. In 2009 the Bulls faced the defending champion Boston Celtics. In game 1 Rose dropped 36 points. This set the record for most points scored by a rookie in his debut playoff game. The Celtics eventually beat the Bulls in an exciting 7 game series that set the NBA record for most overtimes in a playoff series with 7. The next season the Bulls lost to the No. 1 seed Cavaliers and in 5 games. In May of that year head coach Vinny Del Negro was fired. In early June longtime Bull Kirk Hinrich was traded to the Wizards along with the 17th overall pick Kevin Seraphin for the rights to Vladimir Veremeenko. While the current Bulls era began with drafting Derrick Rose, the hiring of Boston Celtics assistant Tom Thibodeau made the team what it is today. Thibodeau agreed to a three-year contract in late June. Carlos Boozer, the Bulls big name free agent acquisition, was signed to a five-year $80 million contract that summer. Led by MVP Derrick Rose, a core of Luol Deng, Joakim Noah, Boozer and a bench affectionately called the [Bench Mob](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcROFZX6arMWz4JHEAKky0yGyC9nAGhNfQgiM1yRJAO8rthJ4EgW) finished with an NBA best record of  62-20 in the 2010-2011 season. After making the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 1998 the Bulls lost in 5 games to the Miami Heat. The 2011-2012 season was injury plagued for the Bulls. Newly signed Richard Hamilton and Derrick Rose faced nagging injuries all season. Key contributor C.J. Watson and Luol Deng also missed several games. The Bulls still managed to finish with a 50-16 record good for the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. The Bulls faced the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the playoffs. Although the Bulls won the first game 103-91 the game ended in [tragedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo1UlzDeY-o). With Derrick Rose out and Joakim Noah spraining his ankle in Game 3, the Bulls eventually lost the series 4-2. That offseason the Bulls brought back former player Kirk Hinrich, and signed Nate Robinson, Marco Belinelli, and Nazr Mohammed

**2012-13 Regular Season Summary**

[2012-2013 Starting Lineup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysLfnIWF0r8)

*Bullets of key instances of the 2012-13 season. 1-4 sentences, keep it short and to the point and give an overview of the ups and downs of 2012-13. 5 to 10 of these mini paragraphs*

* Expectations were mixed for this season. Some fans thought this season was a lost cause and that we had no chance due to Rose’s injury. Others expected a solid playoff team.

* We ended 3 big streaks this year. The Knicks’ 13 game winning streak, Miami’s 27 game win streak, and who could forget the Bobcat’s 18 game losing streak.

* Derrick Rose's injury was a constant source of drama all season. The media and fans were constantly wondering will he or won't he. Fans had a split opinion over the issue, but most agreed that we just wanted an answer. 

* The emergence of Jimmy Butler and the Joakim Noah becoming an All-star give Bulls fans a reason to be excited for the future.

* Nagging injuries for Luol Deng and Noah were a constant worry during the season. Some feel that their injuries were only made worse by the amount of minutes Coach Thibs played them as both were in the top 15 in [MPG](http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/assists/sort/avgMinutes).
 Some fans also speculate that Noah's [shoes](http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/outside-shot/Chicago-Bulls-Joakim-Noah-Le-Coq-Sportif-199856811.html) are the reason for his troubles.

* Overall the team missed 113 games due to injuries. In addition to Deng and Noah, key players Richard Hamilton and Kirk Hinrich were often injured.

* Nate Robinson proved to be one biggest steals of the off season. He put up 13.1 PPG and 4.4 APG on a vet minimum contract. He also performed phenomenally in the playoffs, averaging 16.3 PPG.

* In my opinion it was a great season to be a Bulls fan. Although we didn't get too far in the postseason, we had plenty of exciting moments. This years team felt closer to fans than they ever had before. Although it was sad to Nate Robinson and Marco Belinelli sign elsewhere this off season, it's great to see them get deals that they deserve. 

* We ended the season with a 45-37 record good enough for the 5th seed in the Eastern Conference. 


**Playoffs**


* *1st Round: (5) Chicago Bulls vs (4) Brooklyn Nets* 
 The Bulls faced the 4th seeded Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the playoffs. They lost the first game of the series but won the next three. Game 4 took 3 over times to complete. Nate Robinson went off for 34, 29 of them coming in the 4th quarter or later. Kirk Hinrich was injured in Game 4 with a bruised calf and missed the rest of the playoffs. The Bulls lost the next two games tying the series at 3-3. In game 6 Nate Robinson was sick with flu like symptoms, and Luol Deng was out with a [life threatening reaction](http://www.suntimes.com/sports/21647319-579/spinal-tap-turned-into-a-nightmare-for-luol-deng.html) to a spinal tap. In Game 7 the Bulls won 99-93, with Joakim Noah and Marco Belinelli both dropping 24 points. 

* *ECSF: (5) Chicago Bulls vs (1) Miami Heat* 
 The Bulls were ready to play when they met the Miami Heat at American Airlines Arena. The Bulls beat the out of sync Heat (they had eight days off), outscoring them 35-24 in the fourth quarter. The Bulls then proceeded to have their collective ass handed to them in the next three games losing by an average of 23 points. The final game wasn’t as bad losing 94-91. Emotions were [very high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTlLmiNvKbM) this series and there were a lot of moments that in hindsight are [pretty funny](http://dimemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/joakim-noah-ejection.png).
__________


**2013-2014**


2013 Draft | Position | Pick(From) |
:--- | :--- | :--- |
Tony Snell | SF | 20th (New Mexico) |

Tony Snell often draws comparisons to his former high school teammate Kawhi Leonard. I think I would be speaking for all Bulls fans but we would be ecstatic if Snell came close to being that good. Snell will not be the rebounder that Kawhi is but he is the epitome of a 3 and D player. He shot 39% from three in his junior year and he performed well in the summer league as can be seen [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzSU-NY52o4) His defense was very good in college, and hopefully Thibs can turn him into an elite NBA defender. He has great length standing 6’7” with a 6’11” wingspan, but he needs to add some weight to guard bigger competition. While he is listed as a SF some see him projecting into more a guard. Either way he brings great versatility, defense, and most importantly shooting to the Bulls. I was not a very big fan of this pick when it was made (I wanted a backup C for Jo) but the more I see the more I like Tony Snell. 

2013 Draft | Position | Pick(From) |
:--- | :--- | :--- |
Erik Murphy | PF | 49th (Florida) |

Every team needs one. That tall guy that shoots threes. If he makes the team (he probably will due to our money situation and he isn’t that bad) he will fill that role. A phenomenal shooter in college (shot 45.3% as a senior) Murphy could be a decent role player. He does lack athleticism and length which will hinder his defence in the NBA. His shooting is all that matters though as the Bulls are in desperate need of it.


2013-14 FA Addition | Position | Acquired From|
:--- | :--- | :--- |
Mike Dunleavy | SF | Milwaukee Bucks |


**Expectations**  

/u/awesomeoisawe45 : Expectations for the Bulls are high, and I am hoping that we compete for a top three seed. If Derrick Rose can return to even a semblance of his former self the Bulls will have a very dangerous team. Even though we only signed one player in the offseason it was a big signing. Mike Dunleavy is a better overall player than either of the three-point specialists that we had before (Korver and Belli).  Next year the Bulls will thrive on versatility with Hinrich, Butler, Dunleavy, Snell, and Gibson all being able to play multiple roles. With 3 players who have made All-Star teams in addition to Rose, role players like Hinrich, Dunleavy, and Gibson, and young players like Jimmy Butler and Marquis Teague the Bulls have one of the best teams in recent memory.   
If injuries become a problem the Bulls may struggle. The bottom half of the bench is not as deep as it has been in past years. Hopefully young players like Marquis Teague, and Tony Snell can step up and play a role on the team. Nazr Mohammed was a non factor for most of last year but later in the season made an impact. hopefully now that he has had another year to learn the teams schemes he can play a bigger role backing up Jo. I think a championship isn’t out of the question but we have to stay healthy and still have to get by the very tough top half of the Eastern Conference.

/u/wjbc :  The Bulls have great potential this year, but they also have a scary downside. They aren't ten deep, but their top eight (Rose, Butler, Deng, Boozer, Noah, Hinrich, Dunleavy, Gibson) can cover every position. The biggest concern is Nazr Mohammad, particularly if Noah has foot problems again, that's why the Bulls were looking for a center all summer. It seems like they will have to settle for another forward, and maybe not the experienced vet they want.
So if everyone stays healthy, Rose returns stronger than ever with an improved three point shot and foul shot, and Butler continues to improve, the Bulls could contend for the best record in the league. But if not everyone stays healthy, Rose is hobbled, or Butler regresses, well, that's another matter.
Most Bulls fans want to focus on the upside, but perhaps it's not worth going for the best record in the league, perhaps Thibs can learn something from Pops. 55 games seems like a reasonable goal, it could be 60, or 50. If the starters are healthy anything less seems unlikely. But make no mistake about it, the Bulls want to contend this year, they wouldn't be over the salary cap otherwise. There are going to be some changes next summer, so this may be the last chance for this group of players, particularly Boozer and Deng.

nba,[OC] Young Bucks - 2015/16 Milwaukee Bucks,"Something special is brewing in Milwaukee and it’s on the cusp of emerging as the surprising team of 2015-16.

In [2001]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaGnumcc-Co), a trio of Ray Allen, Glenn Robinson and Sam Cassell led the Bucks to within 1 win of advancing to the NBA Finals. Since then they have hovered in a state of mediocrity, making the playoffs 6 times in 14 years – losing in the first round each time. Things reached a devastating low in 2014 when the Bucks tanked their way to a franchise low 15 wins. In that miserable season the Bucks were last in the league in attendance and whispers about the franchise potential leaving town were beginning to be heard.

However things began to turn around for Milwaukee last summer. Jason Kidd was brought in to take over the coaching duties after an acrimonious divorce with the Brooklyn Nets and the number 2 overall pick was used on Duke super freshman Jabari Parker. In their first season under Kidd, the Bucks improved their win total by 26 games and finished with the 6th best record in the East. In the playoffs they gave an experienced Bulls team all they could handle after falling behind 0-3 in the first round before ultimately bowing out in 6 games. All of a sudden the future looked bright in Milwaukee. The city committed $250 million dollars in taxpayer money to [fund a new stadium]( http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-milwaukee-bucks-arena-20150604-story.html) and ensure basketball remained in Milwaukee for the indefinite future.

**Renewed Commitment to Team Defense**

 The biggest turnaround made by Milwaukee last season came from Kidd’s emphasis on winning the game on the defensive end. Despite not featuring any players who were recognized as one-on-one shutdown defenders, the Bucks gelled together as a cohesive defensive unit which was ranked 2nd in the league in points allowed per 100 possessions (after being 2nd to last the season before).

The Bucks had the luxury of having versatile players capable of guarding multiple positions – this made [defending the pick-and-roll]( http://cdn.makeagif.com/media/9-13-2015/NhCQQ6.gif) one of Milwaukee’s strengths last year (Against the pick and roll last season, Milwaukee was 1st in the league in defending the ball handler (0.70 points/possession) and 7th in defending the roll man (0.94 points/possession). The Bucks featured a lot of length and quickness on defense, allowing for them to recover back into position after helping out their teammates and [rotating beautifully as an in-sync defensive unit]( http://giant.gfycat.com/SeveralObedientAndalusianhorse.gif).

Watch [this play]( https://i1.wp.com/giant.gfycat.com/FeminineCriminalCoral.gif) from last season against Washington – Antetokounmpo rotates onto Nenê from the weak side following a screen while Ilyasova and Carter-Williams cut off the baseline to trap Wall in the corner – forcing a cross court pass to Pierce who is met by the rotating Middleton. Antetokounmpo then sprints across the court to pick up Middleton’s man who was left open in the opposite corner, denying what looked like an open shot, and ultimately forcing Pierce into taking a contested jump shot with the shot clock winding down.

The Bucks were also a very disruptive team on defense (Milwaukee led the league in steals (9.6/game) and opponents turnovers per game (17.4/game) last season), denying the passing lanes and causing deflections. [Here]( https://i1.wp.com/giant.gfycat.com/HeartfeltFineDrever.gif) Middleton gets a touch on Gasol’s pass to Butler throwing off his timing and causing Butler to have wait an extra second for the ball to arrive, giving Middleton just enough time to recover and contest the shot.

The Bucks also improved their interior defense last season thanks to the substantial length offered by the frontcourt rotation of Zaza Pachulia, Ersan Ilyasova and John Henson. Milwaukee was 2nd in the league defending shots within 3 feet of the basket as their opponents converted on 58.9% of shots from this range (league average – 62.8%).

**[Milwaukee Bucks Defensive Statistics: 2013-14 vs. 2014-15](https://theloveofhoops.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/screen-shot-2015-09-13-at-11-51-13.png)**

**Midseason Trade and Offensive Struggles**

Milwaukee was 30-23 at the trade deadline when they decided to [deal away]( http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/12348809/milwaukee-bucks-get-michael-carter-williams-miles-plumlee-tyler-ennis-3-team-trade) Brandon Knight and Kendall Marshall in a 3 team trade which brought in Michael Carter-Williams from Philadelphia and Miles Plumlee and Tyler Ennis from Phoenix. Following the trade, the Bucks offense went south as Carter-Williams took over the reigns of the offense. Their true shooting percentage dropped from 54.7% to 51.6% and their offensive rating which was 102.1 before the trade fell to 97.5 (4th worst in the league after the trade deadline).

The Bucks limped to an 11-18 record to finish the season and many in Milwaukee were left wondering what could have been if the opening night roster remained intact until the end of the season. Nevertheless, Milwaukee was never winning a title last season, let alone contending in the East, and by essentially flipping Knight (who was in the final year of his contract and in line to eventually [cash in]( http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13182190/brandon-knight-agrees-five-year-deal-worth-70-million-stay-phoenix-suns)) for MCW, the Bucks were able to secure themselves a young point guard at a cheaper price who still has 2 years left on a (bargain) rookie contract.

Many were quick to point to MCW’s shooting inefficiency as the crux of the problem for Milwaukee’s offensive struggles in the second half of the season. However after he arrived in Milwaukee his shooting improved significantly. After being labeled as [one of the worst shooters in the league]( https://grantland.com/the-triangle/nba-least-efficient-shooters-josh-smith-michael-carter-williams-trey-burke-nerlens-noel-dion-waiters/) while in Philadelphia (and rightfully so), Carter-Williams began to play more to his strengths in Milwaukee and subsequently found his range. He began shooting far fewer 3 pointers and instead attempted more mid-range jumpers between 8-16 feet which he was able to knock down at a fairly effective rate.
Milwaukee’s true shortcomings on offense in the second half of the season came in 3 point shooting and inside scoring.

**[Michael Carter-Williams Shot Chart: Before Trade vs. After Trade](https://theloveofhoops.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/screen-shot-2015-09-13-at-12-18-55.png)**

**[Michael Carter-Williams Shooting: Before Trade vs. After Trade](https://theloveofhoops.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/screen-shot-2015-09-13-at-12-19-15.png)**

Khris Middleton was the only reliable three point shooter Milwaukee had last season after Knight was traded away. As a team Milwaukee shot the three ball pretty good, connecting on 36.3% of their attempts from beyond the arc (7th in the league). However, the lack of players with a range that extended out to the three point line meant Milwaukee’s 3 point attempt rate was only 22.3% (25th in the league). Only 4 of Milwaukee’s regular rotation players attempted threes at a rate greater than the league average (26.8%), and of these 4 players only Middleton shot better than 40% from beyond the arc. You can shoot the ball as well as you want from three, but if you don’t have the players who are confident enough to attempt them at a high enough clip its not going to be of much benefit to you.

In the frontcourt, the Bucks didn’t have any players who preferred to play in the post with their back to the basket. Pachulia and Ilyasova posted up a mere 10.5% and 3.2% last season, respectively, and Milwaukee’s most frequent post up player was Miles Plumlee (18.8%) who played less than 10 minutes a game last season after coming over from Phoenix. Both Pachulia and Ilyasova preferred to generate their offense outside of the paint leaving a big hole in terms of offensive production in the painted area. Only 58.6% of Pachulia’s shots came from within the paint last season and Ilyasova was even worse at 40.3%. As a result the Bucks lacked any real presence inside – they attempted the third lowest percent of shots between 3-10 feet from the basket.

With an offensive void in the paint, one would assume Milwaukee’s wingmen would be able to use this to their advantage and attack the unoccupied areas within the paint with driving scores. Wrong. Milwaukee were average in terms of scoring off the drive – averaging only 16.3 driving points per game (14th in the league) and converting only 44.4% of driving field goals attempted (17th in the league).

**Addressing the Weaknesses**

On draft night Milwaukee used the 17th pick to select Rashad Vaughn from UNLV and then acquired Greivis Vasquez from Toronto in exchange for a first round pick in 2017 (and Norman Powell’s draft rights). During free agency they signed Chris Copeland to a one year deal at the league minimum providing them with 3 new additions that will extend Milwaukee’s shooting range next year.

In one year at UNLV Vaughn was a natural scorer, leading the Rebels with 17.8 points per game and scoring in double figures in 21 of 23 contests. More importantly, he demonstrated some range, connecting on 38.3% of his three point attempts. Both Vasquez (48.4%) and Copeland (53.9%) shot threes at rates higher than any other Buck did last season – and with their additions to the squad it appears Milwaukee is ready to feature the three point shot more frequently in their offense next season. Vasquez is a big point guard who will thrive in Kidd’s offense. At 6’6”, 200 pounds, he shot 37.9% from three last season and with his size he offers the versatility of being able to play off the ball with Carter-Williams or Jerryd Bayless in the backcourt. Copeland was a late addition to the team in free agency and although he struggled last season at Indiana with injuries and finding his range, he has demonstrated in the past that he too is capable of being a wing player who can spot up around the perimeter and knock down shots from beyond the arc (in his first two seasons Copeland made 42% of his three point attempts).

The Bucks biggest offseason signing was Greg Monroe who [agreed to a 3 year, $51.4 million dollar contract]( http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13186937/greg-monroe-chooses-maximum-contract-milwaukee-bucks). Monroe was 1 of 14 players last season to average a double-double with 15.9 points and 10.2 rebounds. His addition to the team immediately solves Milwaukee’s deficiencies in the post and in the paint – Monroe posted up 41.3% of the time last season for the Pistons and was fifth in the league in points scored in the paint (11.4 - Pachulia and Ilyasova combined to score only 8.7 points in the paint last year).

From a defensive standpoint Monroe provides far less in terms of interior defense and rim protection compared to what Pachulia and Ilyasova provided. However, Milwaukee still possesses enough length that Monroe’s defensive shortcomings won’t result in a huge drop off from their superb defensive efficiency from a year ago. Kidd can surround Monroe with lengthy players around the perimeter who can drop down to help Monroe in the post while the aforementioned smooth defensive rotations and versatility will be able to compensate and close out on any open players without creating many mismatches – [example of this shown here]( https://i1.wp.com/cdn.makeagif.com/media/9-11-2015/NARCnt.gif).

Kidd also has the luxury of John Henson who he can team up with Monroe in the frontcourt to fill the void created in rim protection. Henson, who led the league in block shot percentage last season (9.3%), was a great help defender for the Bucks. His length allowed him to [rotate over from the weak side to contest and alter opponent shots]( https://i2.wp.com/giant.gfycat.com/ImmaculateImpureIcelandicsheepdog.gif) when the Buck’s pick and roll defense occasionally broke down last year.

**The Return of Jabari**

Perhaps the biggest addition for Milwaukee in 2015-16 will come from the return of Jabari Parker who missed the final 57 games last season with a torn ACL. Parker was on his way to challenging Andrew Wiggins for the Rookie of the Year award last season averaging 12.3 points, 5.5 rebounds, 1.7 assists and 1.2 steals per game. In his final 7 games before the injury Parker was beginning to come into his own, scoring 15 points a game on 58.9% field goal shooting. The Bucks have been quiet about Parker’s rehab progress this offseason but [rumors]( http://journaltimes.com/sports/basketball/bucks-beat-parker-looking-good-real-good/article_b0760841-d680-5420-9a0a-b5fa80f3d6b5.html) are that Parker is ahead of schedule and on pace to be in the lineup for Milwaukee on opening night.

Parker’s offensive contribution was sorely missed by Milwaukee down the stretch last season and while it remains a question over how much he will contribute to the Bucks in his first year after returning from an ACL injury, his presence on offense will provide Kidd with more options than what he had to work with last year after the trade. In 25 games last year Parker showed he could score in a plethora of ways - most of his points came in [transition]( http://giant.gfycat.com/SomeHelpfulAustraliankestrel.gif) and as a [spot up shooter]( http://giant.gfycat.com/WellinformedSparseHarlequinbug.gif) but he also demonstrated the ability to play with his back to the basket [in the post]( http://giant.gfycat.com/IndolentBlueBrownbutterfly.gif) and off the ball either as a cutter or in the [pick and roll]( http://giant.gfycat.com/PleasedDistantBorzoi.gif). 

**[Jabari Parker – Scoring Breakdown](https://theloveofhoops.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/screen-shot-2015-09-13-at-13-27-15.png)**

Milwaukee assisted on 62.7% of their baskets last season – however only 54.3% of Parker’s field goals came via an assist, demonstrating that he was doing a lot on his own to create offense and scoring for himself – something which can be expected from a rookie. The addition of Monroe and his underrated passing ability and the chance to play alongside Carter-Williams (a pass-first point guard who was not on the team when Parker was healthy) will change that for Parker and provide him the opportunity to feed off his teammates more next season.

**The Greek Freak**

Giannis Antetokoumpo, appropriately nicknamed “The Greek Freak”, broke out in 2014-15 with improvements in all major statistical categories – averaging 12.7 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.6 assists. His field goal shooting rose from 41.4% to 49.1% in his sophomore year primarily from [attacking the basket]( http://giant.gfycat.com/ImaginativeRecentBassethound.gif) and using his length to finish over smaller defenders.

However, a raw talent like Giannis is still limited to being a one-dimensional player on offense. Last year he often [passed up open jumpers and instead drove to the hoop]( https://i1.wp.com/giant.gfycat.com/HideousHeftyInvisiblerail.gif) for more difficult looks – which is okay when you have enough length to create shots even against the elite shot blocking centers in the league.

Only 32.2% of Giannis's attempts came from outside the paint last season which is interesting given he was not a terrible [mid-range shooter]( http://giant.gfycat.com/EssentialCaringEstuarinecrocodile.gif) – he connected on 41.3% of shots between 10-20 feet. With further maturity and confidence with the mid-range jumper, Giannis has the potential of becoming a near-unstoppable weapon on offense for the Bucks next season.

Listed at 6’11” with a wingspan of 7’4”, Giannis is an absolute nuisance to deal with on defense. Much of Milwaukee’s success on the defense last season came from Giannis’s versatility of being able guard multiple positions and switch with ease when defending the pick and roll. He was often assigned with the task of defending the opponent's best perimeter players to which he experienced some success.

**[Giannis putting clamps on Melo]( https://i1.wp.com/giant.gfycat.com/RecklessIncompatibleGar.gif)**

The scariest thing about Giannis is that at 20 years of age and with only 2 years of NBA experience under his belt he remains unpolished in terms of his defensive fundamentals and awareness. Much of his defensive strengths at the moment stem from his physical gifts – relying on his tremendous length and quickness to make up for times when gets caught flat-footed or lost in the pick and roll.

**[Giannis recovers to block Durant]( https://i2.wp.com/giant.gfycat.com/SlimyHastyHalicore.gif)**

This offseason, Giannis has continued to develop his game – he led Team Africa with 22 points (10/17) and recorded 8 rebounds in the [inaugural NBA Africa Game]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8TmogXv8fw) and he has been a key contributor for Greece in EuroBasket 2015. This gives Giannis plenty of momentum heading into next season to set him up for another year where he can elevate his game even further – making him a favorite for the Most Improved Player of the Year award.

 ***

On paper the Bucks are young team not quite ready to compete with the likes of Cleveland, Atlanta and Chicago as one of the elite teams in the East – but following a successful offseason they have built a team capable of challenging Miami, Washington and Toronto for the 4th seed in the East – and home court in the first round. The Bucks haven’t advanced past the first round since that magical season in 2001 so you can expect that changing that will one of their goals next season.

They have spent the offseason addressing their deficiencies on offense. They have a young point guard who has already started to turn things around under the guidance of a coach who was a 10 time All-Star point guard himself during his [playing days]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkPWl1d-elM). They feature a slew of young players who are quietly developing into future All-Stars themselves and I haven’t even mentioned Khris Middleton who is expected to step-up and become the next premier two-guard in the league after [re-signing with Milwaukee on a 5 year, $70 million dollar contract]( http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13178955/milwaukee-bucks-khris-middleton-close-5-year-70-million-contract).

On defense, an elite defending team from a season ago may take a step back following the losses of Pachulia, Ilyasova and Jared Dudley, but they still possess so much length and versatility that you can imagine that step back to be a minor shuffle. A potential 5 man lineup of Vasquez-Antetokounmpo-Parker-Monroe-Henson in crutch time of close games will look pretty devastating on the court and I can’t wait to see what kind of frustrations they cause opposing offenses next season.

They also feature a lot of depth following their offseason moves. The second unit of Bayless-Vasquez-Mayo-Copeland-Henson is more than capable of holding their own against opposing teams’ second units.

Things definitely look a lot brighter in Milwaukee now compared to how they looked 12 months ago. The interest in the fan base was lost and the city had no real motivation to keep this storied franchise in town for much longer. However with the addition of a new coach and the infusion young talent with tremendous upside all that negativity has been squashed. A [new home]( https://theloveofhoops.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/150408-arena-plaza-full.jpg) awaits them for 2017-18 and it’s not far-fetched to think that by then the “[Fear The Deer]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KA-OPunEDRc)” campaign will be back in full force with Monroe, Parker, Antetokounmpo and Middleton all in their primes competing amongst the elite teams in the Eastern Conference.

GoNets,Barclays concession workers (not mobile carts) are tipping themselves 30% on every purchase. Watch out next game.,"Hey everyone,

I work at a stadium back in Boston, I am a heavy tipper. All game I was tipping 25% + to every beer cart when I would get beers (friend's B-Day so a few stops at the beer cart) With the mobile devices, they give us the option to tip

Not the concessions stands. 

--

At halftime, we went for food. After the hot dog stand ran out of buns we had to go to the cheese steak stand. Bought two beers and a cheese steak. Total was like $45. On the machine it said either $58 or $59 so I could tell something was up. 
 ---

I asked ""hey why is the total so much higher than the price of it?"" Her colleague said ""TAX ITS TAX"" - so I ask ""OK can I turn the screen so I can tip?"" Immediate response ""No its fine you can just pay. This happened to my friend right after at the same stand - thats when it hit me that the stand was tipping themselves

----

This is not me trying to rat anyone out, like I said I work at a stadium I know people do shady shit - but usually against the company not the customer. So any Nets fans looking to go to a game this year be weary of concessions stands, if they dont turn the screen to let you tip, odds are that they are tipping themselves and doing it heavily.

\#	|	Team	|	Δ	|	Record	|	Comment	|
--: 	|	:--	|	:--	|	:-:	|	:--	|
1.	|	[](/GSW) Warriors	|	+1	|	43-10	|	The Warriors weren't quite clicking on all cylinders pre all-star break with a couple of narrow victories on the road over the 76ers and TWolves. After the break the Warriors put on  a dominating performance against the Spurs which was a big relief as the Spurs seemingly have had their number for years... including the last 5 regular season games. This big win was followed up by a poor  performance against the up and coming Pacers.  Get your ankles better Steph, your offense is desperately needed for this road trip coming up.	|
2.	|	[](/MEM) Grizzlies	|	+1	|	40-14	|	After a ten day All Star break, the Grizzlies returned to action last night in Portland with a 13 point comeback in the 4th quarter due to their defensive prowess. This is the earliest the franchise has won 40 games into the schedule. The Grizz will play the Clippers twice this week, including a home game with a flip-flop giveaway.	|
3.	|	[](/ATL)  Hawks	|	-2	|	44-12	|	Hawks have been grounded from their previous high. Going into the break having given up a 11 point lead into the 4th quarter was difficult to swallow but the 4 all-stars made it better. Then the Raptors came out with fire and gave the Hawks a whooping. Korver seemed to be human for once too. The Hawks will have a couple of interesting games this week to shake off the rust.	|
4.	|	[](/CLE) Cavaliers	|	+1	|	35-22	|	The Cavs did not directly become part of all the trades that occurred over the past week with the trade deadline. They did, however, indirectly benefit from the Thunder/Jazz trade, as Kendrick Perkins was bought out of his contract and has committed to signing with the Cavs in the near future. The Cavs looks to alleviate PF Tristan Thompson from having to play most of his minutes at the Center position while Mozgov got a breather during games. The team continues to learn to play off of each other's strengths, especially on the defensive end. A few notable upcoming games include facing both red hot teams in GSW and ATL, as well as a matchup with the Dallas Mavericks.	|
5.	|	[](/HOU) Rockets	|	-1	|	37-18	|	The All-Star break provided a much needed rest for Harden whilst the trade deadline showed Morey is content to ride out this season with the current squad, making only minor moves. Recent losses against quality WC teams due to paint defense and offense show the importance of Howard but if the quality of play from the Rockets bench (Smith, Brewer and Jones) continues, it should hopefully be enough to maintain a high playoff seed.   	|
6.	|	[](/TOR) Raptors	|	--	|	37-18	|	A tough loss to Houston in the most recent game doesn't hurt as much considering it was preceeded by an absolute drubbing of the Hawks. Toronto is now clearly out of its rough patch and is humming quite nicely for the second half. James Johnson is making the most out of his starts and has been a key player for the team with his effort. Down the stretch, the hope is to find TRoss' confidence for the playoffs, to keep Amir healthy and keep pushing JV to becoming the dominant big man he can be. Shout out to Chris Bosh, we will always have love for you big homie and we wish you a quick and relatively easy recovery from the blood clots. We want you out there killing it every night. Much love.	|
7.	|	[](/DAL) Mavericks	|	--	|	38-20	|	The Mavericks started the second half of the season in a rough manner, but everything has clicked the last two games (vs HOU, CHA). Amar'e looks like he could be a better version of Wright, which is hard to imagine, and the defense is improved. The Mavericks need to prove they can beat the top tier teams more consistently, but right now they have the 4th most wins in the NBA. Granted, they have played the most games, which helps them going forward.	|
8.	|	[](/LAC) Clippers	|	+3	|	37-19	|	So the bottom didn't quite drop out after all, huh? Even without Blake Griffin, the Clippers have performed admirably against a [continuingly elite gauntlet of competition](http://www.clipsnation.com/2015/1/28/7930795/los-angeles-clippers-nba-season-most-challenging#postasb). The schedule doesn't let up anytime soon, though — from now until March 15 the Clippers play 9 games against contending teams, along with a pair of SEGABABAs with spunky Minnesota. Not counting the Wolves, the Clippers' SOS over this stretch is a jaw-dropping .679, meaning the teams they'll be playing have an average record of 37-17. This shouldn't be a big deal though for one of the only two NBA teams to go undefeated over the last two weeks; Los Angeles also piled up a league-leading 15.8 net rating over that time period. Bring on the flip flops!	|
9.	|	[](/POR) Trailblazers	|	-1	|	36-19	|	All-Star break didn't do much to right the ship in Portland. They've come out of the gate losers of two straight while losing Aldridge to another hand injury. On the plus side, Afflalo looks like a natural fit. With a little time, he should help the team immensely. 	|
10.	|	[](/OKC) Thunder	|	+4	|	31-25	|	The Thunder haven’t lost a game since the previous power ranking. Despite Kevin Durant’s recurring foot problems, All-Star MVP Russell Westbrook is putting together his case for regular season MVP by averaging 30.6 points/9.4 assists/6.8 rebounds/1.4 steals on 49.5% shooting and a ridiculous 95.7% from the line. With new additions in Enes Kanter, DJ Augustin, Kyle Singler, and Steve Novak this team is looking the best it has all season.	|
11.	|	[](/CHI) Bulls	|	-1	|	35-21	|	The Bulls have won 5 of their last 6 and also have a league high 19 road wins, matched only by GSW/ATL/DAL. They started their 7 game home stand with a win over Phoenix and are looking to improve their record at the UC. After Saturday, Chicago took sole possession of the league's best 4th quarter scoring margin as well. Portland was in a tie with them for 1st overall in that category previously.	|
12.	|	[](/SAS) Spurs	|	-3	|	34-21	|	It's been a tough season for Spurs fans — not quite as bad as this [surprisingly not-satirical columnist](http://www.expressnews.com/sports/columnists/roy-bragg/article/These-are-the-times-that-try-Spurs-fans-souls-6095474.php?t=2f072439a439a20598&amp;amp;cmpid=twitter-premium) would have you believe, but not the most optimistic of times either. But one difficult back-to-back stretch doesn't mean the end of the world, and San Antonio still has plenty of opportunities to get things right. It's becoming more and more unlikely that they'll ever recreate the feared juggernaut we saw in last year's Finals, but even a mortal Spurs team poses as much of a challenge as anyone else in the West.	|
13.	|	[](/MIL) Bucks	|	+3	|	31-24	|	Management did something I have never seen in my lifetime. Feeling that Knight was not a core piece, they traded him for youth and future development rather than for an aging star/rental to try and bark loudly from the 6th seed. Yes, the team got worse immediately. No this isn't SOB. Let's hope Kidd's crush on MCW is more well founded than high school butterflies. 	|
14.	|	[](/WAS) Wizards	|	-2	|	33-23	|	Entering All Star break losing 6 of 8, the Wiz needed another option off the bench.. Instead we traded one of our better role players for nothing. Post break has begun with double digit losses to the Cavs and Pistons. In February only 3 players are averaging 10+ points and Garret freaking Temple is the only player shooting over 33% from 3. This team is losing it's way at the worst possible time.	|
15.	|	[](/NOP) Pelicans	|	-2	|	28-27	|	Just when things start looking up, the Pels get battered by injuries. This time, to both their PFs, an area they were precisely deep at. Norris Cole looks like a good pickup and Gordon remains red hot, but the world may never get to see this team at full strength.	|
16.	|	[](/PHX) Suns	|	-1	|	29-27	|	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-eYPCeCAAAGn-V.jpg	|
17.	|	[](/MIA) Heat	|	+1	|	23-31	|	Talking about a rolletcoaster of emotions. There was such excitement in the air with the trade of Goran &amp; Zoran Dragic but unfortunately hours after it being announced reports of Chris Bosh getting rushed to the hospital starting surfacing online. CB will miss the rest of the season (including playoffs) w/ blood clots in his lung, fortunately he is expected to make a full recovery. Something not many fans in /r/nba are aware of is that Ethan J Skolnick has reported McRoberts is likely to be back sooner than later, so we've got that to look forward too. Some rumors too about the Heat pursuing Blatche &amp; Beasley as we inch near April.  	|
18.	|	[](/DET) Pistons	|	+1	|	23-33	|	The Pistons traded 40% of their starting rotation on the Trade deadline but have gone 2-0 since then (3-1) since the last rankings. The with acquisiton of Reggie Jackson the Pistons show they are trying to make a push towards the playoffs. They won their first game back from the All-Star break against the Chicago Bulls with only 10 active players. This was followed by a win Sunday night against the Wizards, the main component to these games was the powerful presence of Andre Drummond and Greg Monroe as well as an increase in Defensive intensisty from the rest of the team. Look for the Pistons to make a strong push for the 6-8 seed in the east.	|
19.	|	[](/IND) Pacers	|	+1	|	23-33	|	The Pacers began the ""second half"" of the season in terrific fashion- walking all over Philly and edging out (an, albeit, sans-Curry) Golden State. GODney Stuckey and CJ Miles have been tremendous the last few weeks, and the offense as a whole has never looked better this year. Now just a half-game of the eighth seed in the playoff picture, Indy must keep pace with division rival Detroit if they wanna go dancing. All eyes on #theRETURNmidMarch	|
20.	|	[](/BKN) Nets	|	+1	|	22-31	|	With KG's departure the Nets have turned the Prokhorov era has turned it's final page. [Thaddeus Young is apparently the future.](http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/brooklyn-nets/post/_/id/22254/nets-plan-on-keeping-thaddeus-young)	|
21.	|	[](/CHA) Hornets	|	-4	|	22-32	|	Let's face it: Charlotte is dangerously close to being stuck in the purgatory of mediocrity.  There are promising young pieces, but no one looks like a star in the making.  The Hornets have found themselves in a no-win situation: first-round exit or low lottery pick?	|
22.	|	[](/UTA) Jazz	|	+1	|	20-34	|	2-1 since the last update! Over the break, we lost Enes Kanter for some low value assets, Rudy Gobert was snubbed for the Junior Varsity all-star MVP, and we just played a great game against Portland. Hollinger has the jazz officially in the top 15 of his formula rankings, and our playoff odds have risen from 0 to .3 !!! We did it yall!	|
23.	|	[](/SAC) Kings	|	+1	|	19-35	|	Boogie was an all-star and George Karl is the new coach.  There were finally two positives.  Unfortunately, there is still a lot of work to be done.  I attended both Karl's first game in Sac vs. the Celts and his 2nd game against the Clips in LA, and I can tell you that this team is both already different and still the same.  At times, a brand new style of ball has shown itself as the Kings have made beautiful passes down the court and been more confident from 3.  And at other times, they are still stagnant, immature, and figuring things out.  If they can win half of the rest of their games, I'll be a happy fan.	|
24.	|	[](/BOS) Celtics	|	-2	|	20-33	|	The Celtics beat Atlanta and lost to the Lakers (and Tony Brothers). They added Isaiah Thomas and lost Jared Sullinger to injury. The last two loses are a big blow in the race for 8th but Thomas will solve some of the C's problems for the final 30 games.	|
25.	|	[](/ORL) Magic	|	+3	|	19-39	|	The Magic look like a whole new team under Borrego, going 4-2 since he took over vs the Lakers earlier this month. Granted the competition is relatively weak, they haven't allowed 100 points yet under Coach Borrego. Borrego is getting the most out of players, and it's gotten to the point where playing Willie Green isn't such a bad thing, after all. The Magic, while in the bottom 3 of the Eastern Conference, have just 3 less wins than the 8 seed, in Brooklyn, and 4 wins less than the 7 seed, Miami. The Magic are riding a 3 game winning streak, their best of the season. Confidence is high in Orlando surrounding the Magic. They have played the most games in the NBA (tied with Dallas), and with rest, this team could start winning more games, more often, especially with the way Vucevic is playing.	|
26.	|	[](/DEN) Nuggets	|	-1	|	20-35	|	The Nuggets entered the All-Star Break as losers in 13 of their last 15 games. How did the front office respond? By trading a grand total of two players for trade exceptions, a 1st round pick (with another 1st round pick being sent out), Will Barton, and two bought out players in Claver and Robinson. After a relatively quiet trade deadline, the Nuggets have nothing left to do except lose their way to a high lottery pick. *Go Nuggets...!* 	|
27.	|	[](/MIN) TWolves	|	--	|	12-42	|	Wolves shined during all star weekend. The pups dominated in the Rising Stars challenge as Wiggins took home MVP. Zach LaVine both killed and resurrected the dunk contest. Wolves were also in the headlines of the trade deadline as they brought back franchise legend Kevin Garnett as both a mentor figure and provide some interior toughness in limited minutes. Even with the injuries to Anthony Bennett and sensational sophomore Shabazz Muhammad the Wolves vets still look to close the season strong. 
28.	|	[](/PHI) 76ers	|	-2	|	12-43	|	The trade deadline saw the Sixers trade away reigning ROY Michael Carter-Williams for the LAL top-5 protected pick in next years draft. To replace him Hinkie brought in a favorite of his Isaiah Canaan from Houston to take over the PG duties for the rest of the season. Honestly there is no telling where the season is headed from here, but the offense should get better and the defense could get a little worse.	|
29.	|	[](/LAL) Lakers	|	--	|	14-41	|	We beat the Celtics at home after an epic collapse at the end of the 4th quarter. Our season championship has been won. Inconsistent lineups, guys not playing one game and starting the next. Just B Scott things.	|

\#	|	Team	|	Δ	|	Record	|	Comment	|
--: 	|	:--	|	:--	|	:-:	|	:--	|
1	|	[](/TOR) Raptors	|	+1	|	30-12	|	The injury riddled raptors have reclaimed the #1 spot in the east following some big short-handed wins against the Bucks and Pacers. Without Lowry we suffered tremendously, in aspects of the game such as ball movement, pace, and even shooting. This is largely in part due to the spacing and assists Lowry can create for us, and our important shooters such as Danny Green suffered without him. We’ve also been missing JV which has in turn forced us to play Greg Monroe for some heavy minutes. While he may be viable in certain matchups, there’s other matchups where he’s been tortured defensively. Thankfully our team has managed to hang on and play decent enough basketball through all the injuries, although I can’t help but feel that Lowry would have returned sooner had he not forced himself to play injured in his hometown of Philly. Regardless, Lowry is back, the Raptors are back, the east has been put on official notice, and expect a win streak to begin piling up. All we need now is JV. Also, shout out to Chris Boucher.	|
2	|	[](/MIL) Bucks	|	+1	|	27-11	|	Comfortably leading the league in net rating (+9.2 pts/100 posessions compared to the 2nd place Celtics' +5.9) the Bucks have had a very strong stretch, despite the most nationally notable events being their recent loss to the Raptors, and Harden passing Giannis in the MVP race (to no fault of his own, Harden is just playing unprecidently well on offense). The Bucks also have the 3nd weakest remaining schedule, so they appear primed to fight for HCA in the East all the way down to the wire.	|
3	|	[](/DEN) Nuggets	|	+1	|	26-11	|	Aside from brief hiccups in LA and San Antonio, the top team in the West has continued rolling along as Nikola Jokic (26 pts, 11 reb, 9 ast per game since previous ranking) continues to build his case for MVP and the All Star Game. (Friendly reminder that Jokic is currently **7th** in frontcourt voting, so go ahead and [throw a couple votes his way](https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+vote) if you're reading this!) The returns of Gary Harris and Paul Millsap should help relieve some pressure on Jokic and Jamal Murray by providing a much needed offensive boost, and will help a defense that had been the best in the NBA prior to the injuries piling up.	|
4	|	[](/GSW) Warriors	|	-3	|	26-14	|	Warriors have shown their potential throughout games but have stretches of sloppy play that have led to potential blowouts becoming close games and losses. The Warriors closing line up with Iguodala has a 43% rebound ranked which is 3% lower than the worst rebounding team in the league. Warriors don’t quite look like the dominant team we’ve seen these past 2 years and have some holes that need to be patched.	|
5	|	[](/IND) Pacers	|	+1	|	26-13	|	Despite another loss to Toronto, Indiana finds themselves in good position moving forward. The Pacers defeated the teams they should have defeated, and currently sport a 3 game cushion for a top-4 seed. Friday night's heart-stopping win in Chicago showed that Indiana is still capable of winning with late-game heroics from Victor Oladipo if the balanced scoring isn't quite there on any given night. The Pacers must continue to take advantage of their relatively easy schedule over the next few weeks, as the opponents will begin to ramp up in strength over February and March.	|
6	|	[](/OKC) Thunder	|	-1	|	25-14	|	Death. Taxes. Oklahoma City losing close games in Dallas. In other news, optimism is fading regarding Russell Westbrook's jumpshot, but Paul George's brilliance and the team's league-leading DRTG have proved enough to hold pace for the West's 3 seed and a Top 5 SRS in the league.	|
7	|	[](/HOU) Rockets	|	+5	|	22-16	|	Despite injuries to Eric Gordon and Chris Paul, James Harden has shown the NBA that he alone can drive the Rockets to wins in what has been an amazing stretch for him. Although the Rockets fell to the Trail Blazers a couple days back, recent wins against Golden State and OKC, in addition to a 10-2 run for the past dozen games, have shown that the Rockets are ready to contend this year. With Paul and Gordon rejoining the team over the next couple weeks, Harden will get the rest and support he needs to propel the Rockets to a successful season.	|
8	|	[](/SAS) Spurs	|	+5	|	23-17	|	Full disclosure: My rankings this time around are a full on homer bias, but I’ll be damned if the Spurs weren’t, at worst, the second-best team in the NBA throughout December and now into early January. I concede respect to Harden’s mind-boggling run and give the Rockets their due at number one, but a number of statistics [actually supports my claim that the Spurs might very well have been the best team in the NBA since December 1st](https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ad8qtr/the_san_antonio_spurs_have_been_the_best_team_in/), sporting the best Offense, 3rd-best defense, and far and away the best overall Net Rating (15.1) of any team in the league. Kawhi returned on January 3rd, and as someone in attendance at the game (I actually wore my Kawhi Jersey and did not boo), the experience was carthartic to say the least; I haven’t felt emotion like that in the AT&amp;T Center since Game 1 of the 2014 Finals, when 2013 was still clearly on every San Antonian’s mind. Aldridge returned to form in December and Derrick White emerged as a new spark plug on the team; he has averaged 18 ppg over the Spurs’ last 4 games on 28-35 shooting. DeMar, though somewhat inconsistent scoring at times, finds ways to impact games regardless, and has rounded out his defense and playmaking this season and especially over this stretch. **We demand to be taken seriously!**	|
9	|	[](/PHI) 76ers	|	-2	|	26-14	|	Jimmy I swear to god if this happens a third time. Hopefully not, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't at least slightly worried. Beyond classic NBA drama, the Sixers are one of the most top heavy teams in the league, showing so frequently by getting off to huge leads early in the game, only to blow them as the game goes on. We've been getting away with it recently, but it's not a good look. Two solid bench pieces would go a long way for this team.	|
10	|	[](/BOS) Celtics	|	-1	|	23-15	|	The Celtics are 4-2 since our last powerrankings. With victories over the 76ers, Grizzlies, Timberwolves, and Mavericks, and losses against the Spurs and Rockets. Hospital Celtics continues to be the name of the game, but things look very hopeful with the resurgence of Jaylen Brown and Gordon Hayward who have been playing extremely well as of late. Until our next rankings, the Celtics will be playing 8 times including **two back-to-backs**, and 5 games in 7 days. This could be a rough stretch for the already depleted Celtics, with matchups against the Nets, Pacers, Heat, Magic, Nets, Raptors, Grizzlies, and Hawks. 	|
11	|	[](/LAC) Clippers	|	-1	|	23-16	|	The Clippers are 4-2 since last rankings, but their 2 losses came to good teams: SAS (8-2 in their last 10) and the 76ers (7-3), one of which was on the second night of a back-to-back. Gortat is still finding a place in the offense, as well as Boban who hasn't played a lot of meaningful minutes in his career. Bradley continues to find his groove, making some stellar 3s every once in a while, and SAG continues to look like a franchise good.	|
12	|	[](/POR) Trail Blazers	|	-1	|	23-17	|	Jusuf Nurkic is establishing himself as Portland's third best player, and he's doing it in dramatic fasion. The Bosnian center is averaging 22.2p/12.5r/4.2a/1.7s/1.3b in just 31.3 minutes over the past six games. He also recorded the NBA's first 20p/20r 5x5 game. If he can keep this up the Blazers will be in a good position going forward, as they have the second easiest schedule in the western conference in the back half of the season (after Utah).	|
13	|	[](/UTA) Jazz	|	+6	|	20-20	|	Per [David Locke](https://twitter.com/Lockedonsports/status/1081757080934146048?s=19), Since the Kyle Korver trade the Utah Jazz have the 2nd best efficiency differential in the NBA. It has been only 39 days since the trade with Cleveland, but the then 10-12 Jazz have rattled off a 10-8 record while playing one of their more difficult months on the schedule. With Utah wrapping up a road trip in Milwaukee tonight, they'll then have a 4-gane home stand where they can prove they've turned a corner in the season and continue to work towards the postseason dream.	|
14	|	[](/MIA) Heat	|	+4	|	19-19	|	Point Winslow is the greatest Justise Winslow we've ever seen. I am excited to see how will he continue to improve while playing the point guard position. 	|
15	|	[](/LAL) Lakers	|	-7	|	21-19	|	Fourth quarters and Lakers meltdown, no better combo. Lakers fans have gone up in arms over Ingram and Ball over their play recently as Lakers pile on the losses with LeBron, Kuzma and Rondo all out to injuries. Our defense has been on par if not better before LeBron went down, but the offense has taken a complete nosedive. We've been able to play 2-3 quarters of good basketball, but when the fourth quarter hits, we average almost 10% lower in FG% than the previous 3 quarters and allow teams to outscore us by an average 10.4 points in our 5 losses. On the bright side, we played so bad the Wolves had to fire their coach.	|
16	|	[](/BKN) Nets	|	+5	|	20-21	|	The Nets are looking primed to make the playoffs with John Wall being sidelined for the remainder of the year. Without their best player in LeVert,Russell and Dinwiddie have taken turns really leading the offense. D'Lo has been scoring efficiently and taken on a real leadership role on the floor - even on defense. UNDEFEATED IN 2019 BTW	|
17	|	[](/MIN) TWolves	|	+5	|	19-21	|	Good home stand for the Wolves. KAT has been a dominant force on both ends and should garner all star considerations. Oh and the Wolves fired Tom Thibodeau after a 22 point win over the Lakers. Timing is weird but something that desperately needed to be done.	|
18	|	[](/SAC) Kings	|	-4	|	19-20	|	The Kings are just 1-5 in their last six games, with four straight losses to Western Conference playoff teams. The Kings desperately need help in the frontcourt, Marvin Bagley’s absence has had a profound impact on the team’s ability to stay in games consistently. Encouragingly, Fox and Hield have not missed a beat and have continued their excellent play, and are kinda like Wall and Beal except they’re actually good.	|
19	|	[](/DAL) Mavericks	|	-3	|	18-21	|	The Mavs welcomed Dennis Smith Jr back last week, but the Mavs are 2-4 since his return. Most recently vs Philadelphia, Ryan Broekhoff and Jalen Brunson exploded in a game where depth was limited. If the Mavs cannot fix their road woes by the end of the month, consider them sellers at the deadline. 	|
20	|	[](/CHA) Hornets	|	-3	|	19-20	|	It’s been a rough two weeks for the Hornets. They sit one game below .500 with four games remaining on their six game road trip. Cody Zeller is making his yearly visit to the inactive list and Jeremy Lamb is battling a hamstring strain at the moment as well. The bright spot lately has been rookie PG Devonte Graham. A 4 year player at Kansas he plays very under control and at worst has a future as a legit backup PG in the NBA.	|
21	|	[](/NOP) Pelicans	|	+2	|	18-22	|	I don't even know what to think about this team anymore. Over the last 2 weeks they are 27th in defensive rating (114.7) yet are somehow 6th in net rating thanks to an offensive output of 121.0 (absolute tops in the league for the past 2 weeks). We are the kings of losing close games right now. Of our 19 losses since the beginning of November, only 3 have been by double digits. Only 2 others have been by more than 6 points. So we have 14 losses in the last two months that could've easily swung the other way. It's been a major disaster, and the hole we have to climb out of is massive, but the playoffs are still doable. AD is probably already on his way out, but at least we can attempt to have some sort of success before he's gone. 	|
22	|	[](/DET) Pistons	|	-2	|	17-20	|	The Pistons are on the verge of collapse. The offense is terrible, the defense is minimal. Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond are great but not great enough. Things are bleak.	|
23	|	[](/MEM) Grizzlies	|	-8	|	18-21	|	The Grizzlies we saw early in the season seam like a thing in the past. Over the past 22 games the Grizzlies have gone 6-16 including losing 5 in a row. With the Parsons era over with there's only up from here right? 	|
24	|	[](/ORL) Magic	|	+1	|	17-22	|	I love DJ Augustin and everything, but Weltham seriously need to make a move for a point guard if this team is going to go anywhere. Putting Simmons over Grant at the backup point is a decent stop-gap solution but it's not enough. Along with second half implosions becoming all too common, it seems that another trip to the lottery is in line for the Magic. One good thing to come out of all of this though? An aggressiveness from Mo Bamba on the defensive end that had yet to be seen from the rookie.	|
25	|	[](/WAS) Wizards	|	-1	|	16-24	|	The Wizards can't even tank right. To be honest, I'm not exactly sure what direction the Wizards are taking for the rest of the season. Washington has been .500 in their last 8 games, blowing out the competing Thunder while losing to struggling teams like the Bulls and Pistons by big margins, and refusing to play their young talent in the process. The key to any Wizards win seems to be rebounding, as Washington is undefeated when they outrebound the opposition (see the win over OKC, where Sam Dekker outrebounded every Thunder player except Westbrook); however, this is rarely the case. As I've said before, only time (and trades) will tell if the Wizards choose the path of a first round blowout playoff exit to Milwaukee, or pack it in and buy a lottery ticket to Ziontown.	|
26	|	[](/ATL) Hawks	|	--	|	12-27	|	Turns out that getting your two best big men back from injury and giving your two starting rookies a few months of experience is good for a team's record. Who'da thunk it? Since John Collins' return, the Hawks have actually looked like an NBA basketball team the majority of the time. Collins has been a walking 20/10 the past few weeks, now averaging 18.5/10.2 on the season and is making a strong case for being maybe potentially an injury-replacement All-Star or possibly the 12th All-Star in the East. Having won 6 of their last 10 games the Hawks currently sit 5th overall in the 2019 NBA Draft, much to the chagrin of many Hawks fans.  Even if we don't land the number one pick, I have to have faith Travis Schlenk will make whatever the best decisions are with our two lottery picks on draft day. 	|
27	|	[](/NYK) Knicks	|	--	|	10-29	|	Tough week for the Fiz Kids, but the win felt good, even though it came at the cost of Frank's ankle. Mario Freakin' Hezonja, as amazing as it seems, was the spark needed to secure the win against the LeBron-less Lakers. Mitchell Robinson is out an additional couple weeks with a strained groin and Kanter won't travel over the pond because he doesn't want to find poison in his crumpet, so Luke ""White KP"" Kornet will be our only player above 6'9 for a bit. In positive news Knox is looking like a legit threat from all levels and says that his doctors estimate he'll grow another inch over the next year. Meanwhile, Exodus Commander Mudiay continues to lead the Chosen Squad to Zion, as the race to land the phenom at No.1 enters its second leg. 	|
28	|	[](/PHX) Suns	|	--	|	9-32	|	Just as it looked like the Suns turned the corner, they turned around and have lost 6 straight. The Suns have made a bad habit of falling behind big early and almost coming all the way back. New year New Josh, I guess. Since the clock ticked 2019, he has rattled off his best stretch of the season averaging 16/6/3 on 58% shooting off the bench (last 3 games.) Deandre Ayton continues to dominate and ooze with potential even in this six game losing streak, averaging 19/10/2 on 65% shooting with 2 steals (last 6 games). Give the big guy the ball more!!	|
29	|	[](/CHI) Bulls	|	--	|	10-30	|	This is a weird team. We're bad, but we're a fun bad. Management is in shambles. We just traded our leader in minutes played by a wide margin for draft picks (!) and trailer trash, and cut Tank Commander Payne to make room for said trash. The $20 million Jabari Parker experiment is over after only 30 games. The Young Core(TM) are almost all healthy again with Bobby Portis's upcoming return. I'd contend that the Bulls are the best bad team to watch right now, but they will continue to remain irrelevant until the end of the season Tankathon rolls around.	|
30	|	[](/CLE) Cavaliers	|	--	|	8-32	|	Sooo Zion Williamson looks real good right now. Blowouts, injuries and plain bad basketball has been the name of the game for the Cavs recently. If they're actively trying to tank they could really try to do better at hiding it, our second half differentials in the past two weeks were a stunning average Net Rating of -25.5. Seriously. Memphis was #29 at -12.3. Whatever you watched and supported in the past two weeks, I sure hope you turned it off at halftime and thought about best case scenario.	|",209,127,2019-01-07,https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/adlwk6/official_rnba_power_rankings_6_010719_new_year/

I decided to get accommodations this year to bring water in because that $11/game adds up. After emailing them I got the good news - you don't need an accommodation to bring water bottles in!

wnba,New York Liberty owner Clara Wu Tsai gave her team NBA-like amenities. The investment helped them reach the WNBA Finals,"When the couple bought the Liberty, they began putting real resources behind the team. They moved games to the Barclays Center (which the Tsais own), built a new locker room, added performance staff and front-of-office staff—the kinds of resources that are standard in the NBA. They then recruited star players like Sabrina Ionescu, Jonquel Jones, and Breanna Stewart. “We wanted to make New York a destination for great players,” Wu Tsai says.

“This rivalry helped change the league,” Wu Tsai says. “We showed that we could fill an arena with 17,000 fans—not just any fan, but a very engaged, rabid fan base.” Merch sales were up 100% from last year, she added, and the series set a two-decade viewership high.

GoNets,Good morning Nets Fam,"Seems we keep growing more and more every day. I remember when we had just a tick over 5k in this sub like it was yesterday. We were seen as a laughingstock franchise at the time and now? You know.

&amp;#x200B;

Today everything changes. We don't know exactly how and nothing is definite til pen hits the paper, but everything changes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever we do, let's not take it for granted. Our minds might be a little Kyrie, but our hearts are a lot of Dinwiddie. And Harris. And Caris. And Jarrett. Patience, determination, hard work, and a team-first mentality got us to this point and yes, I say ""us"" because the fans are just as much a part of this. Some a little longer than others, but we've helped build this machine outside of Barclay's just as much as Marks and everyone built it inside. Enjoy this. For as much and as long as possible. The ride's about to get even more crowded and about to move even faster and we can't forget to enjoy it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Brooklyn, for as long as I've lived here, has always been about hustle. The rewards of hustle are always, *always* earned. It doesn't matter what version of Brooklyn you currently live in, or have lived in, the spoils of drive and ambition never change. And now we've seen that play out in front of our eyes. Enjoy it, at least for today.

GoNets,The 2019 NBA draft lottery shows that the Brooklyn Nets made the right decision by not tanking.,"When the 2017-2018 started, there was a lot of noise among Brookyln Nets, for we would finally have our very own first round draft pick since the infamous Brooklyn Nets-Boston Celtics trade that took away all of our draft picks for the foreseeable future. It was expected that tanking would be mentioned and suggested, and it was understandable, who here wouldn´t want to get a chance at the top prospects like the Duke stars, Bol Bol, Hunter, Morant, Culver or any other player?

&amp;#x200B;

The Nets though, didn´t choose the tanking route, instead choosing to fight for a playoff spot with the newly drafted players Rodion Kurucs and Dzanan Muza, as well as with improving players such as Dlo, Caris Levert and Jarett Allen. Our efforts were rewarded with the 6th seed of the Eastern Conference Playoffs, where we unfortunately lost to the Philadelphia 76ers with a tough and heart-breaking five game series, that although dissapointing, did bring a lot of experience for our players and coaches and knowledge for our front office.

&amp;#x200B;

The Nets eventually ended up with the 17th, 27th and 31th picks of this year´s draft, highlighting that the 17th pick, our own, is going to be our highest selection, as long as no trades are realized, since 2010, when the Nets selected Derrick Favors with the 3rd pick. This marks a new era of Brooklyn basketball, not because the team is going to draft a superstar or nothing like that, but because they got their independance back and can now finally decide its own destiny.

&amp;#x200B;

Then again, the tanking questions come back. 17th pick and it is our highest in 9 years? That is a long time, we surely could come back to the lottery with a bang, with one of the league´s worst records and therefore, highest odds to the 1rst pick coudn´t we? Who knows, we might have even seen Zion on a Nets jersey if we won around 16-24 wins right?

&amp;#x200B;

But it doesn´t work like that anymore, the lottery has changed, no longer does the worst team have the best odds to get the 1rst pick, now the odds are almost equally divided between the 4 to 5 worst teams, and the repercussion of this rule change showed yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

The New York Knicks, our biggest rival,  choose the tanking route that was so suggested a year ago, winning only 17 games, the worst record in the NBA. The hype was high for the Knicks fans, Zion pretty much became necessity, the organization became dependant of an asset they didn´t have, the first pick of the draft, that could be used with Williamson or for a potential Anthony Davis trade. Well, the Knicks ended up with the 3rd pick, that doesn´t sound too bad, but it is well known that every player besides Zion in this draft is a consolation prize, and that is what the Knicks are going to get.

&amp;#x200B;

So where does this end for the Nets? Well, I can´t say I know of course, I am not a magician or a time traveler, I am just a 16 year old Brazillian that has been watching this team for no longer than 4 years. What I can say is that by not tanking, we surely avoided many anxieties that come with the constant losing we have all experienced for so long. But what is most important is that, at the end of the day, we didn´t follow the norm, we didn´t just ""tank the hell of it"", hoping for a superstar on the draft that could never come. At the end, we stayed true to ourselves, we fought, and yes, we did ""Go Hard"" as most people would say. We won, we lost, we came back, we ""went front"", if I may invent an expression, our players took an elbow in the face, our team made one of the craziest comebacks of all time, we took bumps and bruises along the way, but at the end we did what many teams that tank and take their fans for granted will never do.

&amp;#x200B;

wnba,"WAPO: WNBA fandom is shifting to a more tribal, toxic atmosphere","NEW YORK — Eulalia Brooks has been going to New York Liberty games since 1997, the WNBA’s inaugural season. Through playoff heartbreaks and sparse crowds, she found solace in a community of season ticket holders who maintained a cheerful spirit through the team’s — and the league’s — darkest days.

Then, last season, after nearly three decades, everything clicked.

The Liberty finished with the league’s best record. Average attendance spiked from 5,300 in 2022 to 12,700 in 2024. A new energy coursed through the packed stands, and as the playoffs approached, celebrities filled the courtside seats at Barclays Center.

Brooks was there for one particularly raucous September afternoon, when the two-time defending champion Las Vegas Aces came to Brooklyn. So were Jordan Chiles and Dawn Staley, Stephen Curry and Devin Booker, Paige Bueckers and Azzi Fudd, plus more than 15,000 others. The crowd roared with high-pitched cheers from children of all ages — toddlers in parents’ arms, girls in youth basketball uniforms, preteen boys doing TikTok dances on the overhead scoreboard as 1990s R&amp;B pulsed through the arena.

With the reigning MVP, A’ja Wilson of the Aces, out with an injury, the Liberty surged to a 20-point lead in the third quarter before Kelsey Plum led a comeback that put Las Vegas up by one late in the fourth.
Skip to end of carousel


A nervous murmur rippled through the crowd. Then a whistle. A foul on Plum, apparently her sixth and final. Fans erupted in approval — until the correction was announced: It was actually Plum’s fifth foul.



A chorus of frustrated groans. A smattering of boos. A heavy silence. Then a voice, a man, bellowing from somewhere up high:

“F--- you, Kelsey! F--- youuu, Kelseeeey! F--- youuuu, Kelseeeey!”

Heads turned. Faces soured. It was the sort of heckling once unheard-of in the WNBA but one that athletes in major men’s sports would find more familiar — part of a global sporting culture of aggressive tribalism in the world’s most profitable games. A growing number of men have directed their attention to women’s basketball, contributing to a popularity boom that has driven up WNBA revenue, television ratings and cultural relevance. Some have brought old traditions with them.

The WNBA has faced a surge in verbal and online abuse directed at players in the past year-plus, including racist and antigay statements. The league’s players union has criticized Commissioner Cathy Engelbert for failing to condemn that behavior and called on fans to “lift up the game, not tear down the very people who bring it to life.” The league, in turn, launched a “No Space for Hate” campaign urging fans to treat players respectfully, including a pregame video message announcing a “zero-tolerance policy for discrimination” and strips of paper placed on some premier seats proclaiming that “fans who act inappropriately will not be tolerated and may be subject to ejection.”

More fans mean more money to pay players, more nationally televised games, more sellout crowds energizing the atmosphere. But it also has meant more expensive tickets, more money being gambled on games and — most alarming to longtime fans — more divisive voices crashing into a community centered on inclusion.

It’s a shift Brooks and other longtime fans fear is only beginning. The abusive behavior comes from a still-small fraction of fans who have taken to the sport swiftly and dramatically, leaving a stench that emanates across the league. How many more are marching in behind them?

“That space we built in the [WNBA] where we lift each other up, for the first time it’s really being challenged,” said Brooks, 52, a season ticket holder for more than two decades. “Last year was more caustic, more tribal. It’s wild seeing how it’s shifted.”

Brooks savored every game last season — the vibrant atmosphere; the winning; the brief, beautiful moment the wave crests. Though she hopes her team will continue to bring her joy, she recognizes that it might be only from a distance one day soon. She knows what threatens to come next. She has seen it in the Brooklyn neighborhoods surrounding the arena — skyscraper condominiums and a Whole Foods cater to newcomers as rising rents price out longtime residents, wiping out long-standing communities.

The Liberty went on to win its first championship, delivering the euphoria every sports fan dreams of but few ever experience. As the buzzer sounded to end the WNBA Finals, Brooks wasn’t in the arena to feel the confetti raining down. She was at a bar blocks away, watching on TV, because tickets were too expensive.

ONE EVENING EARLY THIS SEASON, friends Andrea Holt, Betty Clair and Edith Blackmon arrived at the arena more than an hour before tip-off like always. The women, all in their 70s, made a beeline for the concession stand, then settled into their lower-bowl seats with trays of hot dogs and fries on their laps to watch the players warm up. As the tip neared, a dance team took the court, lights dimmed, and music bumped. The Liberty’s famous elephant mascot, Ellie, sashayed down the sideline, tossing her floor-length braid in a swooping snap. A large torch rolled onto the hardwood, blasting flames as a public address announcer introduced the starting lineup.

“We are reaping the benefits,” Holt said, raising her voice to compete with the booming spectacle. “When we came up, we didn’t have any of this.”

The women are among a committed group of longtime fans at Liberty games, showing up even as tickets get more expensive. To track the rising costs from last season to this one, around 150 season ticket holders collaborated on a spreadsheet that calculated their seat prices rising by an average of around 75 percent, from around $48 to $84 per game.

“Astronomical,” said 58-year-old Freda Hudson, a former season ticket holder who plans to attend just a few games this season. “It’s the price of progress.”

In a letter to season ticket holders, the Liberty explained that the rising rate “is based on what the market is calling for.”

“With greater success comes greater demand,” the letter stated. “This is not a decision we make lightly or in haste.”

To mitigate costs for its most loyal fans, the team offered discounts based on how far back customers signed up for season tickets, capping the markup at 25 percent for the longest-tenured cohort. For Holt, who sits near the front, that brought the price to around $2,750 for her 22-game season ticket package this year.

“You got to look at what the ladies are fighting for, more money, and don’t expect that’s not going to impact ticket prices,” she said. “Next year, I know it’s going to go up again, but that’s my commitment.”

Holt was in the stands for the Liberty’s first home game, at Madison Square Garden in 1997. Those early years were exciting as superstar Teresa Weatherspoon led the team to four WNBA Finals appearances in six seasons. In those days, players and fans interacted often. The team hosted picnics where season ticket holders could mingle with players, and players greeted familiar faces in the stands. After games, Holt and other fans would join players for dinner at a restaurant near the arena.

“That was one of the things we cherished,” Holt said. “Because it was as if you were talking to a friend.”

Holt and other longtime fans said they didn’t see opposing players as enemies to trash-talk but as collaborators in the burgeoning effort to promote women’s basketball.

For Brooks, a lifelong sports fan, the experience felt entirely new. She had grown up in Philadelphia attending Eagles games with her dad and watching spectators hurl snowballs at opposing players. She learned a dictionary’s worth of curse words and witnessed brawls that ended with bloody noses and handcuffed police escorts.

She understood that sports offered a space where men felt comfortable expressing emotions they otherwise suppressed, that built up until they could be released on game day.

“Sunday football was about decompression before the start of a new workweek for my dad,” she said.

And between game days, when her father, who is Black, showed up for his job in public transportation, sports offered a common ground to connect with White male co-workers, cutting through the tribalism of racial tensions by rearranging the divides into the tribalism of Eagles and 76ers devotion.

“I understand hardcore fandom and in particular being a kid in that kind of space,” she said. “Those spaces are very male spaces. But the [WNBA] has always been about building something for ladies and trying to build something different.”

There have always been men at Liberty games but for a long time only a few. Drawn to the WNBA’s tight-knit environment, they largely assimilated into a fan culture predominantly shaped by Black women.

Gary Hotko, 42, was a teenager when he started attending games with his mom in 1998. She had season tickets with friends, and sometimes he would join. He remembers male classmates making snide remarks when he wore Liberty shirts to school. His response was usually something along the lines of “Go to the game and tell me you’re not having fun.”

“NBA didn’t really do much for me,” Hotko said. “Football never done anything for me. WNBA was my gateway into sports as a fan.”

He and his mother were among the contingent of steadfast supporters who followed the Liberty through a nomadic period that withered away much of its audience.

The team, under Knicks owner James Dolan, played at Radio City Music Hall for six games in 2004 as MSG hosted the Republican National Convention. When Dolan moved home games to an arena in Newark from 2011 to 2013, Brooks convinced her friends to make the trek by pitching a “staycation” experience, complete with a hotel room and brunch. After the team moved in 2018 to a tiny, 5,000-capacity arena in Westchester County, deep in the suburbs north of New York City, came years that Hudson described as “very depressing, just seeing the dissipation of the fan base.”

“There weren’t that many season ticket holders left,” Hotko said. “That’s when you knew who the die-hards were.”

“No matter where they went, we went,” Holt said.

After Joe and Clara Wu Tsai, who own the Nets, bought the Liberty from Dolan in 2019, they moved the team to Brooklyn. The Tsais invested heavily in the franchise, with a new practice facility and splashy free agent signings, along with certain luxuries standard for NBA players but absent from the WNBA. In 2022, the WNBA fined the Liberty owners $500,000 for secretly flying players on a chartered jet, a violation of the league’s collective bargaining agreement at the time.

But the Liberty was merely a forerunner. Two years later, as women’s basketball surged into mainstream popularity, the league began providing chartered planes for all teams.

“The level of care now that the players receive from the league has been great to see,” Hudson said. “These women are finally being treated as full working people.”

CINDY CAPO-CHICHI WENT TO HER FIRST Liberty game in 2023, shortly after she moved to Brooklyn for a new job. Though she played basketball in college and had seen her share of men’s sports live, she had never attended a professional women’s sporting event.

Growing up in Paris, she was in the stands for many Paris Saint-Germain soccer games, including against rival Marseille, at which the tensions between the rowdy fan bases were “almost scary,” she said. She felt a similar vibe at the New York Knicks game she had recently attended, where fans “are going to be shouting disrespectful stuff,” she said. “In men’s sports, there’s a lot of hate.”

She didn’t expect anything different at her first women’s professional sporting event. “That’s the only thing I knew,” said Capo-chichi, a 33-year-old clothing designer.

But what she found, instead, was a climate of collective support that expressed an appreciation for the game without the combative tone she assumed was universal across major pro sports.

“It was a surprise,” she said. “It’s so uplifting. It’s a community atmosphere with women’s sports. I knew I was going to go to a lot of games because I loved it so much.”

She arrived just in time to watch the Liberty reach the WNBA Finals for the first time in 20 years; it lost by one to the Aces in the deciding game. Attendance rose to an average of around 7,800 that season, a 30 percent bump from the previous year.

Capo-chichi noticed that while there was a sizable minority of men in the audience, they didn’t behave as at NBA games. Most of them came not in groups with other men but with their children or partners. She never saw anyone who appeared drunk. She rarely heard curse words shouted. A coat of playfulness insulated emotional outbursts. Nobody seemed to take things too seriously.

“You can see that they’re more relaxed,” she said.

That year was an inflection point for women’s basketball. The college game rose to mainstream prominence as new fans poured in to watch Caitlin Clark’s record-breaking shooting at Iowa, as well as her budding rivalry with LSU’s Angel Reese, who paired a gritty playing style with flamboyant fashion sense. Both entered the WNBA the following season, bringing their bright spotlights with them.

Among the new WNBA viewers was Jeffrey Cranor, 49, a Dallas Mavericks fan from Texas who moved to New York City in 2006, started watching women’s college basketball a few years ago and bought Liberty season tickets in 2024, fully aware that he was “one of the countless number of generic middle-aged straight White dudes who found women’s basketball because of a White woman in Iowa who was uniquely talented,” he said.

Recognizing that he was entering a space with a different set of expectations from what he was used to in men’s sports, he tried to “learn a lot from the other fans around me who have been following the [WNBA] longer than I have,” said Cranor, whose lower-bowl season ticket price rose from around $1,600 in 2024 to $2,000 this year. “It’s more inclusive, not hypermasculine. There’s a spirit of celebration. You regularly hear really big ovations for players who have been in the league for a long time. As a [Mavericks] fan, we always used to boo the hell out of Tim Duncan, but people don’t do that when A’ja Wilson comes to town.”

Over the course of the 2024 season, longtime Liberty fans said, the presence of men at games grew from a trickle to a flood. Hotko, who had long been one of the few men regularly attending Liberty games, noticed the shifting demographics by the middle of that season, when he suddenly found himself “amazed that there are now lines at the men’s room,” he said.

He felt the change, too, around the city, as more men walked around in Liberty gear, and at the office, where he began to witness male co-workers “who are die-hard Knicks, Rangers and Yankees fans starting to talk about the WNBA.” Friends who had repeatedly turned down his offers to join him at Liberty games suddenly jumped onto the bandwagon. One now texts him a photo of the Liberty shirt he wears on game days. Another tells him about the wagers he makes involving Liberty players.

All those years, “I’m inviting him to Liberty games, and he says, ‘No, no, no,’” Hotko recounted. “And now he’s betting on them.”

Capo-chichi first noticed the vibe shift online, where she runs a women’s sports Instagram account that suddenly absorbed an invasion of mean-spirited viewers. A new breed of spectator had stormed into the league, bringing along the aggressive attitudes that have defined men’s sports fandom.

“Anytime there’s negative comments, it’s from men, never from women,” she said.

According to data collected by Moonshot, a company that tracks online abuse, nine of the 10 most targeted U.S. athletes in 2024 were women.

“The interest in women’s basketball has increased the level of exposure, and the arrival on the scene of more female celebrity athletes has intensified the problem,” said Vidhya Ramalingam, the company’s founder. “My suspicion is that almost 100 percent of those perpetrators would be men.”

Harassment against players “gathered steam and intensity over the last year and a half,” said Nadia Rawlinson, co-owner and operating chairman of the Chicago Sky, which recently partnered with Moonshot to address threats against the team’s players. “As the league grows and people pay more attention, we can show what’s possible in how fans experience games and that it doesn’t have to be so aggressive to the point where you tolerate abuse.”

After Liberty star forward Breanna Stewart missed a critical layup during a WNBA Finals game last season, she reported that she and her wife received derogatory emails.

“We love that people are engaged in our sport but not to the point where there’s threats or harassment or homophobic comments being made,” Stewart said. “This year, especially … it’s really starting to happen.”

DiJonai Carrington, who played for the Connecticut Sun last season, revealed that she received an email containing racist slurs and threats of sexual violence after she committed a hard foul on the Indiana Fever’s Clark.

“In my 11-year career, I’ve never experienced the racial comments [like those] from the Indiana Fever fan base,” then-Sun teammate Alyssa Thomas said. “Basketball is headed in a great direction, but we don’t want fans that are going to degrade us and call us racial names.”

After Chicago’s Diamond DeShields bumped Clark to the court on a fast break in a game last season, commenters landed on her Instagram page to taunt her about a tumor she had removed years earlier.

On her podcast, Reese detailed online harassment she has received from Clark’s fans, including death threats, pornographic deep fakes and incidents of stalking.

“Her fans, the Iowa fans, now the Indiana fans — they ride for her, and I respect that, respectfully, but sometimes it’s very disrespectful,” Reese said. “There’s a lot of racism when it comes to it.”

The rivalry between Clark and Reese has pulled the WNBA into the center of the culture wars familiar to men’s sports, in which picking between Magic Johnson and Larry Bird or Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson carries a deeper sociopolitical meaning interwoven with America’s history of racial inequity. Some White male sports fans, including prominent voices such as Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, have appeared to thrust themselves into WNBA fandom for the dual purposes of defending Clark’s honor and denigrating Reese’s accomplishments, sharing clips of Clark getting fouled and Reese missing shots.

For longtime WNBA fans, the mere appearance of Clark’s name in an online forum now serves as a warning to flee.

“You see the first sentence, and you know it’s about Caitlin Clark — oh, it’s not for me; keep scrolling,” said Hudson, the former Liberty season ticket holder who noted that she respects Clark’s talent but is exasperated by her staunchest supporters. “They just want to see the one player and don’t know the other players or don’t know the rules or the unwritten rules, just the idea of the one player who represents all these things to them.”

And the aggressive online tribalism, longtime WNBA fans said, has made its way into arenas. During one recent Liberty game, a controversial foul call spurred two men sitting near the front to stand and berate an official while the women around them remained seated. Booing has become more common — “Men were doing it,” Capo-chichi said, “but they weren’t doing it as hard as when it’s the Knicks games.” Midway through last season, the arena concession stands slightly adjusted their policies to resemble NBA games, removing the caps from water bottles to make it harder for fans to throw them.

“It’s starting to happen,” Capo-chichi said. “It’s going to become like that inevitably.”

That shift has left longtime supporters wondering whether there’s a way to preserve the culture they have built or whether its erosion is an unavoidable cost of the sport’s growth — if the WNBA can narrow the financial gap to men’s sports without losing the atmosphere that made it special to its most devoted fans.

“I just want to enjoy the game,” Brooks said. “I don’t want controversy just yet.”

NINETY MINUTES BEFORE TIP-OFF, the doors opened and fans began trickling into the arena. Capo-chichi and Brooks found their spots in the lower bowl. Holt, Claire and Blackmon kicked up their feet on the empty seats in front of them.

To help cover the rising cost of season tickets, some fans resell the ones for games in highest demand, such as when Clark comes to town, boosting prices to $150 or more just for the nosebleeds. But on this night in May, the Liberty was playing the Golden State Valkyries, the league’s newest team and the latest marker of the sport’s growth — the first of six expansion teams entering the league within the next five years. The Valkyries didn’t have any superstars. Tickets were as low as $40 on the resale market.

Still, the game was nearly sold out. This season, average attendance at Liberty games is around 16,000, just below the Nets’ 17,400 and the NBA average of 18,100.

An hour before tip, clusters of reporters congregated along the baseline. Phone cameras on raised arms along the sideline lit up a mosaic of identical screens showing star center Jonquel Jones swishing jump shots, curling around imaginary screens, driving to the hoop. Her warmup shirt drenched in sweat, she strolled to the cooler for a cup of water, then took a seat on the bench next to a coach holding a tablet showing game clips to review.

In the stands just behind the basket, a middle-aged man wearing her jersey called for her attention.

“Dr. Jones!” he shouted. “Dr. Jones!”

A week earlier, Jones had received an honorary doctorate in humanities from her alma mater, George Washington University, where she also delivered the commencement speech.

“I had to buy another jersey because you wrote all over the other one,” he said cheekily, lifting his black jersey to reveal a white one underneath, which featured her signature.

His voice boomed above the tranquil hum misting through the arena. No other fans were trying to talk with the players. The other early arrivals took in the pregame rituals from their seats, waiting for the arena to fill.

GoNets,Don’t be Surprised if we win tonight,"I say we have a 30-40% chance of winning tonight.

Why?

First it will be a neutral court game. The fans won’t be hype at all. It will basically be a neutral court game with a crowd that isn’t really in to it. Probably not until the 4th quarter.

Second the Pacers might not be motivated. Its just natural to not have the same intensity as playing against super stars like KD and Kyrie.

Third we have just enough scoring punch to run a decent offense. Cam, Mills, Sumner and Yuta. 

Fourth the pressure will 100% be on Indiana. The longer the game is close the more tight the Pacers will get. 

Fifth guys like Cam, Duke, Edwards and Sharpe will be extremely motivated. 

If the Nets start off strong I see this game being close. A hot shooting night may result with a win.",132,55,2022-12-10,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/zhzcwp/dont_be_surprised_if_we_win_tonight/
GoNets,[Analysis] Some of the offensive plays the Nets ran last night and other opinions on various topics.,"So Kenny Atkinson came out after the game and said that the Nets pretty much aren't running any plays offensively. However, watching the game...this was false. I don't really get why he decided to say this. Maybe he said this to shift blame onto himself rather than the players? I don't know. Either way, let's run through some of the plays the Nets ran during the game and hopefully you're able to see some of the options that develop over the course of the game.

***Some offensive plays the Nets ran***

**HORNS set plays**

[First play of the game they run a set called HORNS which has two people FT line extended who set on-ball screens on both sides of the ball handler. They give the ball to Prince, who ends up taking a tough fall-away shot after a DJ screen] (https://streamable.com/1xni7)

[Kyrie starts off with the ball, LeVert and DJ are at elbows, and prince/harris are in the corners. Irving passes to Caris who gets a double ball screen set for him by Irving and DJ, but the play goes no where and leads to a turn over.](https://streamable.com/pycc7)

[Irving passes the ball to LeVert at the elbows. LeVert backs it up and Irving sets the screen for him, while JA rolls to the rim. LeVert ends up making the tough shot over Sabonis](https://streamable.com/03l94)

[Play call ATO. Harris sets a screen for LeVert, then ball screens for Irving, dives to the rim. Prince gets open after a DJ screen and makes the three](https://streamable.com/8e2hs)

[Prince fakes the screen and pops, throws a low pass to a diving JA who gets the and-1](https://streamable.com/ypo4m)

[Same play, but instead of Kyrie passing to Prince after he pops, JA sets the screen, Kyrie drives and passes to LeVert. LeVert shakes Lamb on the drive and dumps it off to JA for the dunk.](https://streamable.com/0bhtn)

[Kyrie brings the ball up. Harris (kinda) screens for Kyrie and pops to three, but Kyrie drives to the rim and gets the and-1.](https://streamable.com/0hjqv)

[Dinwiddie brings the ball up with JA and Kurucs at the elbow. He passes it to Kurucs and JA sets a flare screen for Dinwiddie. Kurucs gives Dinwiddie the ball, but he doesn't take the shot, so he goes to a double ball screen. It goes nowhere, the Nets end up taking a bad shot](https://streamable.com/3a5rv)

**Motion Strong**

[Nets run motion strong to start the third for LeVert, having him go through two stagger screens, which produces nothing. Then DJ ball screens for Caris, who passes to Harris. Harris and DJ then run a two-man game for a three that misses.](https://streamable.com/o5ip5)

[Nets run motion strong for Harris, which turns into a double ball screen for Dinwiddie, who passes the ball to Harris who makes the open three.](https://streamable.com/mmnky)

**Misc** 

[Nets run a play that I've seen called swing-down-flip. Dinwiddie swings to DJ. On DJ's left, you have Kurucs set a pindown screen for LeVert, and on the right you have Harris set the flare screen. The initial play doesn't provide a shot, so Dinwiddie runs P&amp;R with DJ, and passes it to Kurucs, who gets a dunk](https://streamable.com/azosb)

[Same concept, Kurucs sets a pindown for LeVert, who drives to the rim and hits a tough shot.](https://streamable.com/krwlp)

[Kyrie inbounds to Kurucs, who hands it back to Kyrie. LeVert cuts to the rim and Harris uses the DJ stagger screen to get open for the three.](https://streamable.com/cd4n2)

[Nets run what's called the Spain P&amp;R, where a screen is set for the ball handler and a third player sets a screen for the roll man. In this case, Dinwiddie gets a screen set by Allen drives, Kyrie sets the screen on Allen's man during his role. The ball makes it's way to Temple, who gets JA a dunk to end the quarter](https://streamable.com/4hi0y)

[JA sets a pindown for Temple and JA sets a flare screen for Kyrie, who misses the open three](https://streamable.com/j96yi)

***Opinions on various topics***

***So, about the offense***

I know the offense has people up and arms right now because it doesn't look pretty at times, but...it's not anything different from what the Nets ran last year. They are ISO'n two more possessions more than they did last year (from 9 to 11), but the structure of the offense is the same. They have their set plays, but they also give certain players the freedom (Dinwiddie, LeVert, Irving) to run isolation plays for themselves. I think the big thing for the team going forward is having back up plans to when initial plays don't work with more P&amp;Rs and off-ball movement than just pure ISOs.

***So, about the defense***

It's weird to see people criticize the drop scheme of the Nets so heavily to start the season. It's a scheme that's deployed regularly around the league. And it's the same exact scheme that the Nets ran last season, a year where they was tied for 14th in DRTG to end the season and were a top 5 defense after January 1st. Is the scheme not in their favor all the time? Yes, players like Kemba destroyed the Nets because of the scheme. But the Nets were still successful with this scheme last season. The reality for the Nets is that the scheme might be perfectly fine, but the current Nets players aren't good enough defensively to make it work. I personally think that the Nets are getting a little unlucky with opponent makes, but the Nets are making errors that are hurting them. 

[TJ Warren passes to Sabonis who hands it back to Warren for the easy layup. Looks like DJ communicates to Prince to get Warren, but he doesn't. Pretty bad](https://streamable.com/039o2)

[LeVert loses TJ Warren off-ball and Warren scores.](https://streamable.com/r1gtn)

[LeVert has a bad turnover and gives good effort to get back in the play, but he goes to Brogdan who Kyrie also picks up, leaving Lamb open. Kyrie ends up getting lost in the scramble and it leads to a Warren make.](https://streamable.com/a71b4)

[DJ and Temple botch a switch off between Sabonis and Lamb, giving him and open three.](https://streamable.com/0e28k)

[Temple helps off TJ MCconnell since David Nwaba falls behind due to the Sabonis screen. Temple retreats to MCconnell, but Nwaba doesn't go back to Brogdan, who airballs a wide open jumper.](https://streamable.com/r3f3q)

[Late in the fourth when the Nets were down they started to trap Brogdan on P&amp;Rs. In this example, he passes it off to Sabonis who drives. Harris and Irving both help and JA returns to the to get a block. Both Harris and Irving don't need to help here, only one of them should. I want to say Irving should of been the one to do it, but I might be wrong.](https://streamable.com/xen51)

***The bench unit sucks, and it might be time to give Dzanan Musa a test run***

Running all bench unit lineups is either feast or famine in the NBA. Right now, it's looking more like famine for the Nets. Dinwiddie is the only real creator on the bench and they surrounded him with basically 4 non-shooters right now. But there is someone the Nets could turn to that *could* help. You know that guy who (allegedly, according to Netsdaily) was ranked #11 on the internal mock draft in 2017, but hasn't played a meaningful NBA game yet? The same guy whose shown in the Euroleague, G-league, and pre-season that he's a capable ball handler and can shoot at a respectable percentage? Maybe the Nets should play that guy. 

David Nwaba and Garrett Temple have provided little to nothing offensively to start the season, particularly Nwaba. Throughout his career, Nwaba has been a non-shooter and doesn't garner respect from other teams offensively. 

[This is the right play by LeVert after the ball screen by Allen, but Nwaba, a career 33% three point shooter, misses the shot.](https://streamable.com/urh34)

[Dinwiddie drives after the ball screen by JA and passes it to Nwaba, who doesn't take the shot. This is good help defense by TJ, but Nwaba still has space to launch it.](https://streamable.com/pooko)

[Temple fakes the ball screen and gets a pindown set by Allen. Dinwiddie uses this opportunity to drive and he passes to the corner for a TO. This falls on Nwaba to me, who had a wide open three, but instead decided to cut.](https://streamable.com/7zmfc)

[The Nets run a HORNS set and Nwaba is spotted up in the corner. But why? Feel like it would be better served to have a floor spacer if you're going to run these sets.](https://streamable.com/3a5rv)

[Temple fakes the ball screen and moves to the weak side corner. Kurucs, knowing the spacing is bad, tells Nwaba to slide over. Dinwiddie drives and throws it out-of-bounds thinking Kurucs would be at his previous spot. Also partial blame to Dinwiddie because he's jumping and trying to pass](https://streamable.com/7pp5x)

[The Nets run a double stagger screen DHO for Nwaba and he turns the ball over attempting a difficult pass. Why run this play for Nwaba of all people? He's not a threat to shoot off of screens, so people will just go under and block his driving lanes.](https://streamable.com/jy0xr)

Nwaba is Treveon Graham 2.0 for the Nets and he isn't going to drastically change this defense. If the Nets are going to continue to be dead weight on defense, why not just go all in on offense? Musa isn't going to solve all their problems with the bench, but as I mentioned earlier, when this team runs all bench-unit lineups, they have two non-shooters (whoever the center is and Nwaba) and a reluctant shooter (Kurucs) next to Dinwiddie. Having someone who can shoot and run P&amp;R next to Dinwiddie might help a little. However, at this moment, with Musa being called and re-called from g-league practice, I'm guessing they don't see him as someone that's ready to play soon. 

***The upcoming games***

Coming into this week I thought there was a realistic chance that the Nets could end the week 1-5. The Pacers have owned the Nets forever and they run a two-big lineup that hurts the Nets. The Rockets are gonna destroy the defense and no one can guard Westbrook or Harden. Then they have DET (both teams on a B2B), which is winnable, but who knows if Blake/Jackson will play and Drummond is gonna walk into a 20-20 game most likely. After these games, the nets schedule isn't pretty: Home vs NOP, road swing featuring @POR, @PHX, @UTH, @DEN and then they come back home for a soft schedule. The next six games will really tell us where this team is and if the panic button is gonna come out. Hopefully it gets better before it gets ugly.

**If people care: I'm not gonna write about the HOU vs. Nets game on friday because it'll just turn into ""No one could guard harden or westbrook"" or ""they made a lot of threes."" Might do a write up for the DET game if I feel like it.**",127,18,2019-10-31,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/dpuec2/analysis_some_of_the_offensive_plays_the_nets_ran/

GoNets,"[Analysis] Jarrett Allen's dominant defensive performance, first impression on Claxton, Atkinson's defensive adjustments, and other notes","**Jarrett Allen's dominant defensive performance**

Yesterday's performance by JA was easily the best this season and it really stood out defensively. It was a great combination of excellent interior defense and effort. To me, it might of been the best performance defensively in his career, though that may be a little reactionary. Either way, he played incredibly well on that end. 

[Dame and Whiteside run a P&amp;R. JA does a good keeping dame in front of him and recovering to Whiteside for the miss](https://streamable.com/qush0)

[Dame goes downhill after a Rodney Hood screen, but JA deflects the pass. Kyrie saves it, but it goes to the Blazers. JA then closes out to two shooters, which results in a miss. Pretty good effort by him](https://streamable.com/o5afz)

[CJ shakes Dinwiddie and drives to the rim to take a difficult shot, but JA gives an excellent contest making it harder](https://streamable.com/78tkc)

[Dame throws to Whiteside and goes, gets the ball back, but JA gets a deflection on the Lillard pass to Shiteside which leads to a steal](https://streamable.com/2fogq)

[Allen contests CJ's tough floater attempt, CJ gets the OREB, but Allen gets the back side block.](https://streamable.com/dusms)

[Even though Dame makes this shot, JA doesn't fall for his advance dribbling skills and still gives a good contest.](https://streamable.com/ckscu)

[Cumulative effect of JA's rim protection int he game. CJ could of easily went for a left handed lay up and shielded JA off with his body, but since JA has been a deterring presence in this game, he tries a difficult pass that leads to a TO.](https://streamable.com/fa3te)

[Harris blocks the initial attempt my Mario, he botches the second attempt, and the third is blocked by JA who stays with the play.](https://streamable.com/gj4r8)

[Allen shows on the Whiteside screen and Dame goes downhill, but JA stays in stride with him and gets the block from behind](https://streamable.com/9jlh4)

This was easily JA's best performance this season. It feels like the prevailing opinion on him this season has been that he's struggled. I think that may be true offensively (mostly from the FT line), but defensively he's been perfectly fine. 

**Claxton's first impression**

Coming out of Georgia, Claxton showed flashes as a modern center who can guard perimeter players with his defensive skills and long wingspan. He's always in a stance defensively and he has pretty lateral movement which helps him stay in front of guards. His offensive skills are lagging behind his defensive skills, but he has shown the ability in college to play defacto point guard by bringing up the ball to initiate offense in the half court in P&amp;R or play in transition, but the Nets aren't to ask him to do that. He's also shown the ability to shoot the ball from deep, but based on his percentages (3P and FT) in college, he isn't ready to be a perimeter player right now, but maybe in the future. 

Yesterday game vs. the Blazers was the perfect entry point for Claxton's career. The Blazers are currently riddled with injuries to their best two bigs (Nurkic and Collins), who would of most likely overwhelmed them physically. Instead, he got to play and show out against Labissiere, other smaller lineups, and the always lethargic Whiteside. 

[Claxton's wingspan comes in handy off the Temple miss, allowing him to grab it away from Labissiere](https://streamable.com/hzjf1)

[Claxton gets switched onto CJ, stays with him on the drive, and blocks his shot](https://streamable.com/qnffo)

[He shows good effort by going up for the OREB after the Caris miss to get the and-one opportunity](https://streamable.com/si75j)

[Claxton seemed to struggle on how long to commit to the roll man and CJ here, but CJ forces a tough shot that misses with a good contest from Claxton](https://streamable.com/agx0p)

[Another good contest from Claxton on the Simmon's shot attempt](https://streamable.com/rh68a)

[Here he grabs multiple offensive rebounds in traffic vs the Portland guards and forwards and gets rewarded with FTs](https://streamable.com/51g5f). In college, one of his more notable weaknesses was his finishing at the rim. He got pushed off his spots easily and didn't do well with contact at the rim. A lot of this can be attributed to his lack of strength compared to his contemporaries, but it's worth noting. A more physically mature center probably gets the bucket at some point, but it's still good to see him give a lot of effort. 

Overall, Claxton had a pretty good first game. I don't think he was riddled with mistakes defensively. The cases he did get scored on in P&amp;R, it was by Dame who was destroying everyone. I think the Suns game, at least when Baynes isn't on the court, will another good match up for him. 

**Defensive adjustments by Atkinson**

For the ""AtKinSon DoSeN't MaKe AdJuStMeNtS"" or ""dRoP cOvErAgE dOeSn'T wOrK"" crowd, he did make defensive adjustments from the beginning of the game. He deviated from the normal drop coverage that the Nets run. Eventually, he went on to using 2-3 zones, box-and-one / face guarding, and blitzing P&amp;Rs with Lillard. None of it mattered much since Lillard was destroying them, but he cycled through a lot of options.

[For Lillard's first possession with the ball, he runs a P&amp;R with Whiteside, showing a clear different in defensive schemes] (https://streamable.com/u0urp). Normally, if the Nets are playing a non-shooting big (or a big man's shooting who they don't respect), [they drop back](https://i.imgur.com/kcgHIDE.png) to protect the paint and encourage difficult off-the-dribble pull up jumpers. Since Lillard is so good offensively, they can't do this because he can easily make those kind of shots. Instead, they bring Allen up to the same level as the screen and try to force Lillard into other options. 

[Here you see the same sort of deviation from the drop coverage, but involving Whiteside and CJ](https://streamable.com/d3gsk). Normally you'd see JA sag off Whiteside since he isn't a threat from outside of the paint, but since the guard play of the Blazers is so dynamic, they have him playing up on Whiteside.

[Temple face guards Lillard the entire possession, preventing him from getting the ball and forcing the teams to basically play 4v4.](https://streamable.com/7zknn) I want to say this is box-and-one, but the Nets aren't exactly in a box the entire time defensively. Box-and-one is a strategy that's commonly used at high school levels of basketball when the opposing team has a dominant scorer. [In the scheme, you have two defenders on opposite sides of the FT line and two defenders near the baseline opposite of each other.](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR1SSkfRYDPS4Il2JGUdJhbHVKxX5--RASgjbMQRsRW3p6jaWH1CA&amp;s) It's not common in the NBA, however, the Nets did use it last year vs. Kemba Walker. The more notable example would be when the Raptors used it against Steph and the Warriors in the finals. 

In the fourth quarter, we start to see the Nets Blitz any P&amp;R involving Lillard. [In this clip, we see that after a Lillard and Whiteside P&amp;R, JA and Caris blitz against Lillard in an attempt to force the ball out of his hands, which they do.](https://streamable.com/pbhl9) 

[Same quarter, Whiteside hands the ball off to Lillard, who gets blitz by JA and Kyrie. This time, Lillard makes a good pass to Whiteside, who slips to the rim](https://streamable.com/mf4so)

[Whiteside and Lillard are playing a two man game, but Lillard gets trapped by JA and Kyrie late the shot clock and is forced to pass to Whiteside, who misses](https://streamable.com/epo9f).

The Nets pretty much threw the kitchen sink at Lillard and he destroyed. Can't do much but tip your hat to Lillard, but it's worth mentioning the different adjustments made in-game by Atkinson.

**Miscellaneous**

So, there's an offensive play that the Blazers ran yesterday that's called ""Thumbs-Up"" that was used yesterday. [In the play, we see Simons swing the ball to Lillard after Little sets a pindown screen for him. Simons then gets a screen set for him by Whiteside that frees him up for the pass](https://streamable.com/8ad9z). You may think the play design is similar to something that the Nets have run in the last few years, and that would be true! Ironically enough, they got the play design most likely from when Allen Crabbe came out in the deal two seasons ago. [Here's the same play, but done differently by the Nets last season](https://twitter.com/HalfCourtHoops/status/1105256689232764929). Last season, the play was mostly run for Joe Harris. However, the play hasn't been ran at all this season for Harris. Maybe at some point they do run it for Harris or something, maybe they don't, but I thought it was worth noting that Portland used a play the Nets took from them. 

[Dinwiddie after his best performance of this season, first verse and hook only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gru4IfbKlfU)

Kurucs getting benched isn't encouraging at all, but he's been horrible, so it is justified. Nwaba was probably the better play tonight with how good the Blazers guards are. However, Nwaba suffers from the same problem Kurucs does: [He doesn't take damn threes.](https://streamable.com/zwzo4) If Kurucs is benched for an extended period like Nwaba was, the lack of reliable bench shooting is going to continue. In my opinion, Wilson Chandler is most likely the answer they need right now to help the, but since he's out, they'll have to make do. 

Atkinson played Musa again, granted it was for a grand total of six minutes. There isn't much to make of his performance, but post-game Atkinson did mention he played Musa to provide spacing for Dinwiddie (which goes back to the lack of reliable shooting on the bench issue). Maybe this is a sign that we're going to see Musa a little more [(something I mentioned they should consider)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/dpuec2/analysis_some_of_the_offensive_plays_the_nets_ran/). 

It'll be interesting to see what the Nets defensive coverage is when they play Phoenix tomorrow. Aaron Baynes is tippy-toeing his way into threes, so they it'll be hard to play drop coverage against them, unless they really want Baynes to beat them (not the worst idea if it gets the ball out of Booker's hands). I think if Rubio and Baynes run P&amp;R, they sag off since Rubio is a non-shooter, but if it's Booker and Baynes P&amp;R, we'll see the same coverage the Nets used yesterday.",120,8,2019-11-09,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/du1j7g/analysis_jarrett_allens_dominant_defensive/
GoNets,Not trading Bridges to Houston for our picks back was worse than anything that happened in the big 3 era ,"Was a ton of stuff during the big 3 era a disaster? Primarily both harden trades, absolutely. But I believe just about everything they did was justifiable at the time. 

Not trading Mikal to Houston for our picks back was a fireable offense.  Zach Lowe said on his podcast multiple times the Rockets offered all the picks back. Reading everyone’s reporting it seems the only pick that Houston was a little shakey giving back was this draft, but everyone says this draft stinks anyways and nets would have been free to rebuild.

You’d have all your picks going forward, plus your 6 extra firsts from other trades, and then you can trade Johnson, Claxton, DFS for even more firsts.

The front office and/or ownership is in complete denial about this team. I have been advocating for a rebuild since the offseason and was called a Mikal hater for saying last year was not sustainable. Mikal and his contract is worth infinitely more to a team that is trying to win than the Nets. 

You can’t try and be competitive with no all star talent and a dead max salary spot on your books. Once it became Simmons was done 
(which was basically his Nets debut if we’re being honest) the team had to face reality. 

The nets are punting on another season to pray that free agency comes back in 2025, stars just resign and ask out later now. And if we have to trade for say Donovan Mitchell, we will be a play in team with little to no assets. 

The Nets have been burned to historic proportions star chasing. Part of why our crowd is so awful is it’s been 15+ years since the Nets have had anything that resembles a homegrown team that stayed together. That’s what builds fanbases, and you build a homegrown team through the draft and by rebuilding. 

Would it suck to be bad for 2 years? Sure, but it would be sucking with a purpose and a plan, developing young talent who play hard every night. Now we suck for no reason.

wnba,Betnijah Laney-Hamilton's Title With Liberty Was the Culmination of All That Came Before,"As one of New York's longest tenured players, the WNBA veteran finally got her championship moment. But the path to a trophy began well before the 2024 season.

As the longest-tenured Liberty player alongside Sabrina Ionescu, Laney-Hamilton had a front-row seat to New York’s ups and downs over the last four seasons. This year saw landmark viewership and attendance numbers, but the Liberty guard/forward remembers the days of smaller crowds and less media attention just as prominently. 

“When we first started at Barclays \[Center\] together, we didn’t have the crowd that we have with all of the support,” Laney-Hamilton says. “We didn’t have the team that we have and being able to contend the way that we can now, but we’ve just continued to push and grow together as players, as teammates, as members of this organization.” 

Laney-Hamilton knows that the Liberty’s championship does not come without the foundation laid by franchise greats. Former players such as Teresa Weatherspoon attended Game 5 at Barclays Center and also participated in the team’s celebrations throughout the following week. 

The trophy is all the more meaningful knowing the sacrifices that came throughout the 27 years prior.

nba,This year I took another trip from Australia -&gt; USA for another NBA Journey. Thought I would share my experiences again.,"Hey /r/nba - My 2nd home. Almost three years ago I (very unprofessionally) [documented my travels to the USA to see NBA games] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/15om96/recently_returned_from_an_nba_journey_thought_i/) during the 2012-2013 season.

This past season I returned to the States to embark on another NBA Journey, this time with a friend of mine. My friend is a huge NFL fan, so we were lucky enough to also go to a few football games which was great. 

Last time I made a post like this, the reception here was pretty positive, so I'm excited to share my experiences again. We went to 6 games in total around the the east coast. We mostly stayed in New York and travelled to nearby cities to catch games when they were on. I am a huge Celtics fan so I was super excited to see them play again, particularly in this new and very different Celtics era.

Ok, enjoy..

**--Game 1: Phoenix Suns @ New York Knicks [12/21/2014]--**

The night before this game we got to see RunDMC at the Barclays centre. Afterwards we got a cab into town where we camped out on the street all night to get tickets to Saturday Night Live.  We got absolutely no sleep, so I was a complete Zombie at this game and went by myself because my friend opted to sleep instead. Really glad I took some vids and photos 'cause I have almost no memory of this.

In the few times I've been to the USA, the Lebron or Durant were never in the same place I was, so I've never been able to see them. Checking the schedule while planning the trip, I was delighted to see that Lebron's Cavs would be in Philly, only 2 hours drive from NYC where we were staying. I thought, ""Finally"". ""Finally I get to see Lebron"". Also Kyrie and Kevin Love of course. This was the game I was most excited about.

ANYWAY a few days before the game, Lebron gets 'injured' and decides to take his little mid-season sabbatical. Then, a day or so before the game, Kyrie gets injured too. Oh well, off to Philly anyway to see Kevin Love and Delly. This was actually a pretty exciting game and went down to the wire. Philly won it on a game winning Tony Wroten layup.

GoNets,Post-Draft Brooklyn Nets Salary Cap and Free Agency FAQ,"I've seen a lot of the same questions here about the salary cap rules and most of this may be obvious to many of you but I felt it would be helpful to try to clear some of the more common questions up. If I messed anything up or should add something, let me know and I'll do my best to fix/add it.
___

**FAQ1. What do people mean when they say trading away the 27th pick opened up cap space? How much did we open up?**

First round picks all have cap holds at 120% the rookie scale slot until they are signed. Not exactly sure when and where this information was released but it seems for the 27th pick the cap hold is **$1,974,240**. It's not a ton but it could come into play in certain situations and trading for a 2020 pick is a very savvy move as by then it's likely that we'll be operating over the cap anyway.
___
**FAQ2. What current salary obligations do we have? What are some of the likely next steps Marks will take to maximize cap space?**

Below is the current salary cap table:

|Player|2019-20 Cap Hit|
:--|:--|
|Spencer Dinwiddie|$10,605,084|
|Joe Harris|$7,666,667|
|Taurean Prince|$3,481,986|
|Caris LeVert|$2,625,718|
|Jarrett Allen|$2,376,840|
|Dzanan Musa|$1,911,600|
|Shabazz Napier|$1,845,301|
|Rodions Kurucs|$1,699,236|
|Treveon Graham|$1,645,357|
|Deron Williams [Dead Cap]|$5,474,787|
|Incomplete Roster Charge ($897,158 x 3)|$2,691,474|
|**Total**|**$42,024,050**|
|**Projected Salary Cap**|$109,000,000|
|**Cap Space**|**$66,975,950**|

That cap space number assumes we denounce all our cap holds (I imagine we will except for DLo's depending on what we decide to do, more on that later). I expect Marks will also cut Treveon Graham and Shabazz Napier as they have non-guaranteed deals and that gets us to:

|Player|2019-20 Cap Hit|
:--|:--|
|Spencer Dinwiddie|$10,605,084|
|Joe Harris|$7,666,667|
|Taurean Prince|$3,481,986|
|Caris LeVert|$2,625,718|
|Jarrett Allen|$2,376,840|
|Dzanan Musa|$1,911,600|
|Rodions Kurucs|$1,699,236|
|Deron Williams [Dead Cap]|$5,474,787|
|Incomplete Roster Charge ($897,158 x 5)|$4,485,790|
|**Total**|**$40,327,708**|
|**Projected Salary Cap**|$109,000,000|
|**Cap Space**|**$68,672,292**|
___
**FAQ3. Why are different values being cited for max contracts?**

There are 3 levels of ""Max"" Contracts that exist in the current NBA CBA. For the purposes of our discussion, all that is relevant for fitting a player into your cap is their starting year salary. (If you want to know how players are financially incentivized to stay with their current team, players can re-sign with their current team for a 5-year deal instead of a 4-year deal and the current team can also offer them up to 8% raises every year while the new team can only offer 5% raises.) For players with 0-6 years in the NBA it can start at 25% of the cap in the first year. For players with 7-9 years can start at 30% of the cap in the first year. And lastly, any player with 10 or more years of experience can start at 35% of the cap. This is going to come into play depending on who the Nets choose to pursue.

|Years of Experience|Qualifying Players|Starting Max Salary|
:--|:--|:--|
|10+|Kevin Durant, Al Hoford|$38,150,000|
|7-9|Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris|$32,700,000|
|0-6|D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle|$27,250,000|

Keep in mind you can effectively subtract $897,158 from these figures because signing a player would clear one of the incomplete roster holds.
___
**FAQ4. Can we currently sign Kyrie and KD? If not, how can we clear up space?**
As we are right now, even renouncing all cap holds and cutting Napier and Graham, we're a tiny bit short of the space required to sign both Kyrie and KD. We have $68,672,292 of space but need $69,055,684 ($38,150,000+$32,700,000-$897,158-$897,158). That means we're effectively $383,392 short which could be achieved by trading Musa away or maybe even have Kyrie and KD take a little bit less to fit them in without making a trade.
___
**FAQ5. Can we sign D'Angelo Russell, Kyrie Irving, and another max contract? If so, what moves are necessary?**

Since a lot of the media rumblings have Kyrie committed to the Nets and a lot of Nets fans want to keep DLo as well, I've seen this question a lot. And the answer is...it depends. If the two non-DLo players in question are **Kyrie + KD**, there needs to be around **$69,055,684** in cap space. If the two non-DLo players in question are **Kyrie + Kawhi/Butler/Tobias** there needs to be around **$63,605,684**. The best way to go about this would be to not renounce DLo's cap hold so he can count for **$21,059,094** against the cap while we go out and use up the open cap space. 

|Player|2019-20 Cap Hit|
:--|:--|
|Spencer Dinwiddie|$10,605,084|
|Joe Harris|$7,666,667|
|Taurean Prince|$3,481,986|
|Caris LeVert|$2,625,718|
|Jarrett Allen|$2,376,840|
|Dzanan Musa|$1,911,600|
|Rodions Kurucs|$1,699,236|
|**D'Angelo Russell [Cap Hold]**|$21,059,094|
|Deron Williams [Dead Cap]|$5,474,787|
|Incomplete Roster Charge ($897,158 x 4)|$3,588,632|
|**Total**|**$60,489,644**|
|**Projected Salary Cap**|$109,000,000|
|**Cap Space**|**$48,510,356**|

Adding that to the cap sheet and subtracting one of the incomplete roster charges leaves us **$48,510,356** in cap space. 

So keeping those numbers in mind, we can trade **Dinwiddie and Joe Harris** for no salary in return to get us to **$64,987,791**. That gives us enough space to pair together **Kyrie + Kawhi/Butler/Tobias** and then max **DLo** after but it would cost us Dinwiddie and Joe Harris which might not be an attractive move for Marks (unless it's Kawhi). It would probably require Marks to have a way undermarket contract agreement with JJ Redick or something to replace Joe for him to consider it.

-Side note: This is a suuuuuper pipe dream that I hesitated to even include because I'd give it a near 0% chance, but in case you want to know, if the Nets just moved Dinwiddie for 0 salary, Kyrie + Kawhi/Butler/Tobias would need to leave a combined **$5.4M** on the table. It's not exactly unprecedented with KD and Miami Heatles being some recent examples but I wouldn't get your hopes up.
___
**FAQ6. What is the difference in cap space in the DLo vs. Kyrie debate?**

The Nets fanbase has been going back and forth on this issue. It is true that choosing D'Angelo Russell over Kyrie could lead to a much stronger team overall, especially in terms of depth. Since we can agree to a deal with DLo and sign his contract last, he would effectively only count for **$20,059,094** while we conduct the rest of our free agency. After we sign as many players as can fit into the free space, we can go over the cap to sign him to the max. With DLo, we'd have **$48,510,356** to play with which means we could sign a KD or Kawhi/Butler/Tobias level free agent and still have roughly $11.25M or $16.7M respectively to work with. That is a sizable amount that could add a lot of depth to the roster.

The main problem is that signing Kyrie may be the only shot we have at attracting another star to come to Brooklyn as DLo doesn't carry the same cache with his NBA peers. In the case that we let DLo go and choose Kyrie, we would have **$36,869,450** in cap space. That means we'd still need to move another piece to get to the $37,252,842 a KD signing would necessitate and only leave $3,272,292 over if we paired Kyrie with Kawhi/Butler/Tobias. It's arguably still worth it, especially if we believe Marks has a true skill of finding good role players with limited resources but it would undoubtedly be a more top-heavy roster.",101,71,2019-06-21,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/c38x8p/postdraft_brooklyn_nets_salary_cap_and_free/

wnba,"With the New York Liberty, Clara Wu Tsai Aims for the First $1 Billion Women’s Sports Franchise (Full Article)","*Wu Tsai and her considerable family fortune created a superteam (and the WNBA’s defending champions) by treating star players like the pro athletes they are.*

Breanna Stewart—the WNBA scoring leader, two-time champion and Finals MVP, perennial All-Star, four-time NCAA champion, WNBA and Olympics MVP, guaranteed first-ballot Hall of Famer with a 7-foot-1 wingspan—was an unrestricted free agent, and Clara Wu Tsai was hell-bent on persuading her to choose the New York Liberty.

“Stewie,” who’d played all of her seven pro years with the Seattle Storm, was already one of the best players in women’s basketball history. She was seriously considering staying in Seattle, but she wanted to weigh all her options. In January 2023 she informed four teams she’d meet with them, including the Storm and the Liberty. The contenders would have to fly to Istanbul, where Stewart was spending the offseason playing for Turkish club Fenerbahçe to supplement her $228,094 WNBA salary, then the maximum allowable under league rules.

That the Liberty were in the conversation at all represented a major turnaround for one of the only three original WNBA franchises still around a quarter century after the league’s founding. While New York had made the Finals in four of the league’s first six seasons, owner and legendary sports villain James Dolan had unceremoniously put the team up for sale and relegated it from Madison Square Garden to a Westchester arena that felt like a glorified high school gym. Now, less than four years after Wu Tsai and her husband, Joseph Tsai, had taken over the franchise, the Liberty were on the cusp of creating a superteam.

Sign up for Bloomberg's Business of Sports newsletter for the context you need on the collision of power, money and sports.

Just a few days before meeting with Stewart, the Liberty had traded for the reigning league MVP, 6-foot-6 post presence Jonquel Jones, and they were courting All-Star point guard Courtney Vandersloot. They already had sharpshooting guard Sabrina Ionescu on the roster, having drafted her with the first overall pick in 2020. Three years removed from a 2-20 season, New York suddenly looked capable of winning its first-ever championship—if it could land Stewart.

When the Liberty’s executives got to Turkey, general manager Jonathan Kolb and head coach Sandy Brondello delivered a spiel about how Stewart could help them build a dynasty. But the team’s sales pitch ultimately rested on business, not basketball. Leaving Kolb and Brondello behind, Wu Tsai set out to close the deal, chartering a boat to take her, Stewart and Stewart’s wife and daughter on a cruise down the Bosphorus.

Wu Tsai had almost no experience with recruiting, and she admits she was nervous. “It’s not something I had been familiar with, so I was learning,” she says. “It was really about listening to each other, because she’d also never talked to someone like me.”

What she did have was a plan, shaped by years as an executive at American Express Co. and Chinese auction site Taobao, to complete the Liberty’s overhaul from the WNBA’s most moribund franchise into its crown jewel. A basketball obsessive who’d grown up rooting for the University of Kansas, Wu Tsai was hungry to bring New York a championship—or, ideally, several. But her real goal was much larger: She was out to prove women’s basketball could make huge profits, if only team owners were willing to substantially invest in them. And with a multibillion-dollar fortune behind her—her husband co-founded Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.—Wu Tsai was prepared to do just that. In addition to titles, she committed to providing more and better facilities, support staff, brand partnerships, media exposure and business opportunities.

For years, Stewart had advocated for improved benefits and amenities for WNBA players. Some of the world’s best (and tallest) athletes were still flying commercial to games, earning as little as $62,000 a season, practicing at community rec centers and risking injury by playing all offseason abroad. Now Stewart was sitting on a boat with someone whose ambitions were at least as grand as her own. Wu Tsai’s pitch boiled down to: Together we can upend the way things work—not just for the Liberty but for everyone in the league. “I wanted to go somewhere where not only could I fight for a championship but go lock arms with the people who are going to make this league better,” Stewart says. “She made me feel like everything I wanted was exactly what she was fighting for too.”

A few days later, Stewart signed with New York. She even took less money than Seattle was offering, allowing the Liberty to add Vandersloot without exceeding the league’s salary cap. In a TikTok video announcing the news, Stewart tore away a generic jersey on which she’d written, “I want to do my part to make this world a better place,” revealing a sea-foam green Liberty warmup shirt underneath.

During a three-hour interview earlier this spring at a performing arts center near her primary residence in San Diego’s tony La Jolla neighborhood, Wu Tsai doesn’t sound surprised that it all worked out. Short and slim, with highlighted black hair that brushes her collarbone, she looks a decade younger than her 59 years. She has a penchant for fashion, favoring patterned pants, chunky rings, trendy sneakers. She makes intense eye contact when she speaks but rarely raises the pitch of her voice, exuding calmness and confidence in equal measure.

While she steadfastly refuses to publicly criticize her fellow WNBA owners, or anyone else, she also doesn’t shy away from conflict, especially on the question of what players deserve. As she heads into her seventh season as the Liberty’s co-owner and chief decision-maker, she seems more likely than any other single person to reshape the norms of women’s professional sports.

Wu Tsai kept her promises to Stewart. Since buying the team, she’s moved it to Brooklyn’s 18,000-seat Barclays Center from the Westchester County Center—which could hold just 2,300 people for most Liberty games—tripled the number of front-office employees, overhauled the locker room, built an NBA-caliber staff of full-time trainers, nutritionists and physical therapists and helped compel the WNBA to finally make charter flights the norm. In March she announced plans to fund an $80 million practice facility that will include everything from remote cameras and data-tracking technology in the gym to child-care facilities and a beauty salon.

Wu Tsai can’t single-handedly boost player salaries, which are governed by the league’s collective bargaining agreement (CBA), but the WNBA’s rapidly growing profile seems likely to result in a massive raise for everyone in the next contract. ESPN, which broadcast 24 regular-season games last season, reported a 170% jump in viewership for the year, averaging about 1.7 million viewers per game. Attendance was up 48% from 2023, thanks in part to Indiana Fever rookie sensation Caitlin Clark; and merch sales through the league’s website and its Manhattan store grew 601%. The Liberty saw even larger growth in many categories, according to Wu Tsai: up 64% year over year in ticket sales, 152% in season ticket memberships, 80% in corporate partnerships. An investment deal last summer valued the team at $200 million, more than 10 times what the Tsais likely paid. GQ called Liberty games the best party in New York City. A-list celebrities were regularly told there was no room for them in Barclays’ courtside seats.

At the end of last season, Stewart and her teammates won the Liberty’s first championship. For Wu Tsai, hoisting the trophy validated her thesis. “By winning, we finally proved a point,” she says. “We proved that when you invest in women, you can get a championship team, and you can sell out arenas, and you can get a deeply engaged fan base, and you can get a product on the floor that’s as competitive and good as anything you see in the men’s league.”

Wu Tsai isn’t stopping now. By the mid-2030s, she’s pledged, the Liberty will be the first women’s sports team valued at $1 billion. The question now is how many other owners will follow her lead.

For as long as she can remember, Wu Tsai has fixated on fairness. Her grandfather was an activist for Taiwanese rice farmers struggling to support themselves and dismantle discriminatory policies set by the colonial Japanese government. He went on to become the first elected mayor of Taipei after Japanese rule ended. Her father went to the University of Wisconsin at Madison to get an economics Ph.D. before joining the faculty at the University of Kansas and settling in Lawrence with his wife, a fellow Taiwanese immigrant. At night he’d gather other immigrant professors in the basement of the family home to advocate for an end to Taiwan’s martial law, which lasted almost 40 years.

Wu Tsai was born in 1966, two years after her brother, Lawrence. As a young child she heard stories from her father and grandfather about what Japanese and Chinese decision-makers had cost the Taiwanese people, which made her realize she wanted to make a difference in the world. She knew early on that she wasn’t interested in pursuing academia like her father and older brother—writing research papers felt too removed from real consequences. “I don’t have a lot of tolerance for a lot of bureaucracy or bullshit,” she says, before apologizing for cursing. “I have an obsession with results, products, outcomes—the practical married to the new knowledge.”

To this day, Wu Tsai is most comfortable talking about concrete goals. She comes alive when discussing her professional passions. Asked for specific anecdotes from her childhood, though, she turns to the communications rep sitting in on the interview: “I don’t know, can you think of anything that I’ve ever said to you?”

She didn’t play sports as a kid, focusing instead on violin, piano and grades, per her parents’ expectations. She was enthralled by the exuberant fan culture that surrounded Kansas men’s basketball, though, and learned strategy catching games on TV, even as the rest of her family didn’t care much for them. The Jayhawks remain one of her deepest passions; while working overseas, Wu Tsai got up in the middle of the night to watch the team play.

The Wus had relatives in Northern California, so Clara followed her brother to Stanford University, where she majored in international relations. After a brief stint as a junior consultant at McKinsey &amp; Co., she enrolled in Harvard Business School, which raised the eyebrows of her professor father. “Why do you need a degree to do business?” she remembers him asking. “Just go into business!” At Harvard she found she loved her course in technology operations management, the boring stuff that makes a company work. “It was very cut-and-dried,” she says. “You could see your impact, and you could control it.”

When she finished her MBA, she worked for two years on the revenue strategy team at the New York Times, then left to become a business analyst for American Express. She loved the energy of New York and the opportunity to see any concert or art exhibit she wanted. In 1993 a friend set her up with Tsai, a young Taiwanese-born tax attorney. They started with a double date at Fanelli Cafe, a scene-y pub in SoHo, and spent the whole time debating politics so fervently that their friends assumed they didn’t particularly like each other. The other couple offered to take Clara home, but she said she and Joe were going to keep hanging out. They ended up closing down the bar.

She and Tsai bonded over their shared Taiwanese ancestry, as well as their love of business and sports (he’d played lacrosse at Yale University). By the time they were married, three years later, Tsai had become a private equity investor, and Wu Tsai had arranged a transfer to join him in moving to Hong Kong. Soon after that, Tsai met Jack Ma and co-founded Alibaba. The Tsais stayed in Hong Kong for 15 years and had three children there.

Wu Tsai rose quickly through the ranks of American Express, becoming a vice president for international card partnerships, but found working at a massive company stultifying. Ann Chen, a friend of 30 years, says, “We would talk about what it was like as people in our late 20s and early 30s working in a corporate environment, and she just wasn’t satisfied with the pace of change or the ability to create impact, whereas I was very happy. She’s much more bold and much more ambitious.”

Wu Tsai left American Express after eight years, moving on to oversee the Hong Kong operations of Taobao, an Alibaba subsidiary that was essentially China’s answer to eBay. Experimenting to solve new problems felt more exciting than following corporate protocol, she says: “It made me realize how entrepreneurial I was.” In 2013, Wu Tsai stepped down from Taobao and the Tsais moved to the US, settling in San Diego; she was excited for her kids to experience the parts of American life she’d loved growing up.

Tsai, Alibaba’s second-largest shareholder, oversaw the company’s initial public offering the following year. Suddenly the Tsais were billionaires, and Wu Tsai began to think of her work in a new way. She researched which philanthropic causes would allow her to make the biggest difference, pouring money into social mobility interventions and arts programs. But the couple sought profit-making investments too. Their love of sports—they’d pushed their kids to play competitively—brought them to pro franchises, which are scarce by design and thus valuable assets. It was also hard to think of any industry that dovetailed so directly with Wu Tsai’s affinity for competition and clear outcomes.

In 2017, Tsai bought the rights to an expansion professional indoor lacrosse team in San Diego, a baby step toward the couple’s real goal of owning an NBA team. They didn’t want to be stuck as minority owners long term, so they looked for franchises that presented a clear path to outright control. That narrowed the options down to the Houston Rockets or the Brooklyn Nets. The kids voted for Houston: It had superstar James Harden, and the Nets were decidedly the No. 2 team in their own hometown. The parents, though, wanted New York. At the end of 2017 they bought a 49% stake in the Brooklyn franchise. A little more than a year later, they acquired the rest for $2.4 billion, then the highest price ever paid for a sports team. They also bought the Nets’ home arena, the Barclays Center.

To Wu Tsai, owning a basketball team felt like a dream. But the NBA, which owned half of the WNBA at the time, wanted to know if the Tsais might consider buying one more. The Liberty had been losing money for years, and moving out of New York City had made things worse. Multiple potential buyers had balked after looking at the books.

Wu Tsai, though, was intrigued. “The whole sector was underinvested in, and we saw potential,” she says. “We knew that the league attracted the best basketball players in the world, and we knew that New York City was the biggest media market in the world. So we thought, ‘OK, these are some solid business fundamentals.’ ” The Nets, where Tsai was taking the lead, were a mature business; the Liberty needed an entrepreneur. And the failure of her fellow billionaires to invest seriously in women’s sports pricked at Wu Tsai’s sense of fairness. She couldn’t resist the challenge.

In 2019 the Tsais bought the team. Wu Tsai, they announced, would run it.

For most of the WNBA’s almost 30-year existence, many people treated it like a charity case. The NBA owned 50% of the women’s league until three years ago, with the remaining 50% split among the teams. Most owners seemed content to lose money on their franchises. Sports Illustrated reported in 2022 that one owner liked to say his team was worth literally nothing, making everything he spent a generous donation.

The league’s CBA prohibits a range of financial disclosures, and WNBA and NBA executives have always been secretive about even the most basic economic questions, frustrating anyone who believes the league isn’t paying players their fair share. According to Bloomberg News reporting, the WNBA generated about $144 million in league revenue in 2024, up 177% from 2019, but the people in charge won’t confirm.

Wu Tsai wasn’t interested in treating a for-profit franchise as a charity, or in paying players as little as possible. She knew she was committing to years of losing money, but she also saw a route to profitability. Shortly after the couple bought the Liberty, she went on a listening tour of sorts, consulting prominent figures in women’s sports about what they’d change. She drove two hours each way from La Jolla to meet with Billie Jean King—a vocal advocate for greater investment in women’s pro leagues—near King’s home outside Palm Springs. The two talked business strategy for hours and have since become good friends. “People like Clara are a big part of the dream. Without her and people like her, we’re not going to make it,” King says. “She’s actually putting her heart and soul and money into it. It goes beyond just money, but you’ve got to have that starting point.”

The Liberty’s overhaul began with the move to the Tsais’ arena in Brooklyn. It wasn’t without risks. Spending two years losing constantly at a third-tier arena in the northern suburbs had driven away much of the fan base. The pandemic didn’t help, forcing the team to play a shortened 2020 season at a Covid‑19 isolation facility in Florida before starting up in earnest in Brooklyn in 2021. That first year at Barclays, the Liberty averaged fewer than 1,900 attendees per game, even fewer than during their years in the burbs. Many nights, the arena was so quiet that fans sitting in the lower bowl could hear players shouting to one another. “I viewed us as an expansion team coming from Westchester,” says Kolb, whom Wu Tsai hired as general manager. “We really had to start everything all over.”

The only way to rebuild the fan base, as far as Wu Tsai could see, was to start winning. The Liberty hadn’t finished a season above .500 since 2017, and few stars had clamored to work for Dolan. To make New York more attractive, the Liberty began offering better perks: a best-in-class locker room, the biggest performance staff in the league, on-site chefs and a midseason bonding trip to Napa. The Liberty would be a “player-led” team, Wu Tsai told free agents: Whatever they needed, they’d have. “We had that philosophy that we were just going to upgrade everything,” she says. “The North Star was building a championship-caliber team that could bring back the old fans and attract new ones.”

Before her work paid off, though, Wu Tsai’s free-spending ways nearly brought her entire project crashing down. The WNBA had always banned flights on private jets, a longstanding perk for mens’ pro teams, out of a sense of fairness to teams whose owners couldn’t afford them. Wu Tsai, on the other hand, thought it was unfair to make elite athletes cram their long legs into economy seats. So throughout the second half of the 2021 season, she simply broke the rules, chartering flights to away games. When she got caught, the league considered punishments as severe as suspending ownership or terminating the franchise altogether, according to Sports Illustrated. But Wu Tsai eventually received little more than a slap on the wrist: a $1 million fine, later reduced to $500,000.

Her defiance and the charter-flight question dominated WNBA discourse for weeks. Plenty of observers cheered her willingness to give players first-class amenities no matter the cost; plenty of others castigated her for throwing money around when not everyone could do the same. One part of the story got less attention: In the fall of 2021, during the same period the Liberty were secretly flying private, the Tsais proposed charter flights be made the standard travel option for every WNBA team for at least three years, according to Sports Illustrated. But the owners council rejected it, SI reported, in part because they didn’t want players to become accustomed to a perk they might not have forever. (The WNBA said at the time that the Liberty didn’t put forward a formal proposal.)

“It’s tough,” Wu Tsai says about the rejection, then hesitates.

Her communications rep jumps in: “I think that’s one of the things we’re not supposed to talk about.”

But her efforts to woo players with perks worked. She’d already lured in defensive powerhouse Betnijah Laney-Hamilton before the charter flights began. In 2023, Jones requested a trade to New York, and Stewart and Vandersloot both signed out of free agency. With the stars now aboard, the Liberty went 32-8 during the 2023 regular season before losing in the Finals to the defending champion Las Vegas Aces. The next year they took down the Aces in the semifinals, then beat the Minnesota Lynx in a Game 5 overtime thriller to win the title. In the locker room afterward, Wu Tsai strapped on Moët-branded goggles and danced alongside her players, soaked in bubbly and looking giddy. Describing her feeling as the confetti fell, Wu Tsai mimics wiping sweat from her chest in relief.

As she predicted, winning brought the fans back. Upgrading their experience helped too. The vibe at Liberty games began to feel like a Brooklyn block party: thumping music, an all-ages crowd, jubilant toddlers high-fiving trendily dressed zoomers. Ellie the Elephant, a mascot introduced in 2021, became a star in her own right, with a profile in Vogue and almost 200,000 followers on TikTok.

The Liberty aren’t making money yet—all Wu Tsai will say about the team’s finances is that she expects it to be profitable “soon”—but by the end of the 2024 season, attendance was up 470% from when the Tsais took charge, and a new TV deal with the local Fox affiliate was making games accessible to anyone in the tristate area. “She rescued us,” Chief Executive Officer Keia Clarke, who spent eight years working under Dolan, says of Wu Tsai.

Wu Tsai can’t talk about the negotiations over the league’s next CBA. (She’s not a member of the league’s Board of Governors, so she has no official role in the talks.) The day after the Liberty won the 2024 title in October, the WNBA players union announced it was opting out of the current CBA, giving them a year to negotiate a new contract before it’s time for a work stoppage.

With its popularity surging, the league announced last July that it expected to collect $2.2 billion from an 11-year media rights deal with ESPN owner Disney, [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) and NBCUniversal. Yet outside researchers estimate the players are paid an average of less than $150,000 each—totaling roughly 10% of league revenue, compared with 50% in the NBA. (The WNBA won’t comment on these estimates.) They’re not demanding NBA-level salaries, Stewart and other union leaders emphasize, just a revenue share closer to half, plus better benefits for family planning, child care and housing.

Stewart, who serves as vice president of the players union, says she’s optimistic they’ll strike an agreement before time runs out in October. The negotiations are still in the early stages, without concrete proposals or counteroffers from either party, but the conventional wisdom is that the momentum is on the players’ side—they’re more famous and beloved than ever.

They’ve also shown the WNBA isn’t their only option. Earlier this year, with $35 million in private investment, Stewart and Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier launched Unrivaled, a six-team 3-on-3 women’s league that plays during the WNBA offseason. Unrivaled has allowed many top players to avoid the hassle of playing overseas to supplement their income, paying them an average of $220,000 for 10 weeks of games. (According to ESPN, shortly after winning an NCAA championship, University of Connecticut star Paige Bueckers signed an Unrivaled deal that will pay her more in 2 ½ months than she can earn in four years of a WNBA rookie contract.) The new league also offers players equity, which the WNBA doesn’t, plus better amenities and child-care benefits than many WNBA teams. Unrivaled says it made $27 million in its first year from sponsorships and a TV deal with Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. and came close to breaking even.

While the WNBA owners are staying tight-lipped about the CBA negotiations, a growing number of them appear to want to pay their players significantly more. Of course, what works in New York and Las Vegas might not be realistic in the WNBA’s smaller markets, but the old model of owner austerity seems to be losing ground to the new model of spending money to make money. And Wu Tsai continues to stand out as an icon of owner largesse who’s willing to treat players like the top-tier pro athletes they are. “Ever since Clara and Joe came into the WNBA space, they’ve been able to lead differently than anyone else,” Stewart says. “It doesn’t always have to be a fight.”

As the players and owners negotiate over the next five months, the Liberty will be trying to repeat as WNBA champions. They look to have a good shot. Although they lost Vandersloot to free agency and Laney-Hamilton to an injury sustained during the Unrivaled season, their top three players are back and healthy, and veteran guard Natasha Cloud, who came over in a trade with the Connecticut Sun, will pick up some of the defensive burden when their season begins next week.

Wu Tsai longs for another title, but she’s focused on some off-court goals too. Part of the reason the Tsais bought the Nets instead of the Rockets was that she thought Brooklyn would be a good place to concentrate her philanthropic work, much of which aims to help people build wealth: teen boot camps dealing with artificial intelligence and the blockchain, a tech accelerator that invests in founders of color, grants and low-interest loans for small-business owners, an annual social justice prize for people working to improve their communities.

A fervent museumgoer, Wu Tsai also started an arts program in public schools, which initially centered on the work of Brooklyn-born artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and culminated in an exhibition of students’ Basquiat-inspired paintings at Barclays. Next year the program will highlight the work of Rashid Johnson, a friend of Wu Tsai’s, to give students a look at the life of a contemporary working artist. She wants them to understand they have options.

Through the Liberty and Nets’ parent company, BSE Global, meanwhile, the Tsais are planning a major development initiative in the traffic-clogged area around Barclays. Adding hotels and restaurants, Wu Tsai says, will help draw more fans for the Liberty and Nets while also benefiting Brooklyn more broadly: Only a fraction of New York City’s 63 million annual tourists ever set foot in the borough. And though the Liberty’s attendance and TV viewership set records last year, the path to the billion-dollar valuation she craves requires even more.

In the absence of specific numbers from the WNBA or its teams, it’s impossible to know for sure how far they are along the path from charity case to moneymaking machine. Wu Tsai says much of the league’s focus for the next few years should be on monetizing its growing viewership by negotiating better terms for sponsorships and team media deals. The WNBA is also slated to expand 25%, to 15 franchises, by the end of next year: One new team, the Golden State Valkyries, will make its debut this season, followed in 2026 by teams in Toronto and Portland, Oregon. “Expansion teams bring new fans, which just expands the pie for everyone, right?” Wu Tsai says. “What the Liberty managed to do was bring in nontraditional sports fans, not just go after existing people. There’s still so much more growth that’s possible with our team and with the league.”

Two through lines unite her seemingly diverse projects. One is her need for results, the instinct that made her turn away from her father’s academic life and toward the business world. Few things bring her more joy than seeing students’ art on the walls of her family’s arena, or a local business that’s expanded its offerings because of a grant, or the players she’s recruited lifting a championship trophy in front of a sellout crowd—measurable units of the work she’s made possible.

The other is her childhood obsession with making things fair. Asked during the interview in La Jolla about how her desire for equality shapes her work, Wu Tsai initially demurs. She’s a businesswoman, not a utopian. “I’m not Pollyanna. A lot of things in life aren’t fair. So, you know, I don’t ride or die it.”

Nine days later, Wu Tsai sends a follow-up email. She’s been dwelling on the question for more than a week and wants to revise her answer. It’s true that she wouldn’t have invested in the Liberty unless she thought it could make huge money. She needs people to understand that when she says her team will be worth $1 billion, she’s not guessing or being optimistic. But upon further reflection, she’s willing to say she’s just as committed to equality. She could build a billion-dollar business in any number of industries. She needs to prove to all the doubters that she can do it in the WNBA.

“Like all women’s sports, the team had been underestimated and underfunded. We changed that,” Wu Tsai writes. “We bet on women. And we are winning.”

Caitlin Shann attended her first New York Liberty game on pride night in June 2022. The WNBA had not been on her radar, and she didn’t know many people who followed the league. But during her first visit to Barclays Center, Shann, who identifies as queer, felt the Liberty had created a “loving and safe and fun place” for fans like her to cheer, she said. And the tickets were affordable, too.

She attended about six games the remainder of that season and the 2023 season. She was hooked and figured it was worth a season-ticket investment for the following season.

Shann paid $600 for her season tickets in Section 3. The following summer, in August 2024, she was shocked to see her renewal cost. The price nearly doubled to just shy of $1,200 for the same seat and only two more regular-season games. Despite initially balking at the cost, her fandom won out and she re-upped.

“This was now a priority for me in my non-working time,” she said. “I could manage other sacrifices.”

But now, even as the Liberty begin a playoff quest to repeat as WNBA champions, Shann said she won’t be renewing. Not with a new ticket price for her seat increasing to nearly $1,700 for the 2026 season. “The value of what I get as a season-ticket holder has decreased over the last two years as my ticket prices have gone up astronomically,” Shann said.",91,51,2025-09-15,https://reddit.com/r/wnba/comments/1nhp1oq/wnba_fandom_costs_rise_as_growing_popularity/
GoNets,[Rant] Tired of this fanbase,"I get that the journey over the last couple years has been rough, with going from a legit contender in the big three era to where we’re are now, but people need to get a fucking grip and get behind this squad. Do we need a superstar? Yes. Should we screw ourselves in the short term to get one before we have better trade value in developing players or a better understanding of what this squad is capable of? No. Could we use a better coach than JV? Yes. Do we have a better option? No. People need to realise that if we’re actually gonna win a chip we need to be patient and determine what our options are, whether trades or otherwise. If that means being slightly above .500 for a season or two that’s just the way it is. 

All of that aside I am sometimes ashamed to be a Nets fan, and not because of our record or for any of the reasons listed above - but because our fanbase fucking blows. People constantly bitching on this sub after every loss, empty seats at every game (I go to games frequently and have seen as much), barely any noise at said games. 

People gotta realise that regardless of their paycheque etc these guys want to play, and I like to think they give 100% on the court every game. It’s what we do best - being a scrappy no bullshit team win or lose. But regardless of trade prospects or what might happen going forward we need to get behind this group. I can’t overstate how important a teams culture and their fans are - and that’s one of our weaker points. 

I apologise to all of the fans to whom none of the above applies, I really do. But the constant bitching has to stop. That aside, I am happy at how this team sometimes surprises me with their level of play, and I believe good things are to come regardless of how deep a run we make this season. 

We have some great assets and young players, and their value will only get higher as they improve. We have some burgeoning superstars on both ends of the floor who just need a bit of a jump in some areas - things could be worse.

GoNets,It's getting kinda silly now...,"...the way people are reacting to last night's game. There was literally *nothing* on the line last night except for our player's health. Aside from that, though, some of you are acting like you didn't know this year would be a year where the team remained competitive while developing talent. I didn't hear anyone complaining when the game was close through 3 quarters and all these bench players were giving fans a sneak peek of what they might bring to the table down the road. I bet I won't hear anyone complaining when we're happy to see everyone who sat playing max minutes on this upcoming road trip either. Part of getting through an entire season is being mindful of balance and that was what happened last night. Vaughn didn't ""fuck up"" and he didn't treat the game like an exhibition (the funniest thing I've heard in the past 12 hours) and he's not immune to criticism, but some of what's being said about him in this instance is borderline mental. People really wanna see him fired over this? The Nets are not in contention for a title. They have the luxury of being able to give younger players some run and experiment a little bit. Just enjoy the games and be glad there's no drama with ego-maniac stars anymore. ",87,106,2023-12-28,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/18t2ks2/its_getting_kinda_silly_now/
GoNets,"The Athletic Trade Value on Cam Johnson, Dorian Finney-Smith, Day’ron Sharpe and Ben Simmons ","CAM JOHNSON:

Johnson is about as perfect a trade deadline candidate as you can find, because he fits like a glove everywhere and shouldn't be all that difficult to integrate midseason. He's in the middle of a career year, averaging 18.5 points, four rebounds and three assists. One of the league's elite shooters, Johnson is a 6-foot-8 wing who has made 39.6 percent of his 3s on nearly six attempts per game over a six-year career. He's deadly from the corners and can also make shots off all sorts of movement actions because he's one of the rare shooters who can make 3s from nearly any footwork. All you need to do to bring him into the mix midseason is plop him in the corner, allow him to relocate or run him off a few simple actions and he'll provide space for your best scorers and ballhandlers. Defensively, Johnson isn't a difference-maker, but he generally puts himself in the right spots, and he's big enough not to be hunted in mismatches regularly.

The only question here is regarding whether the Nets decide to actually move him. Because he's such a good shooter, he's a perfect developmental player to have around as the team enters a rebuilding era. His contract is also entirely reasonable. Johnson makes $22.5 million this season and has two years remaining for a total of $43 million. Given the way salaries will continue to rise over the next two years, he's probably a bit of a steal for a starting-quality player at that price point. The Nets can keep him and maintain all of their salary flexibility in future years. Because the market for him will be wide with his ability to fit anywhere (and because the team doesn't have to move him), expect the price point to be quite high if the Nets do trade him. Expect at least a first-rounder and a good prospect, if not just two first-rounders outright. Otherwise, they can just keep him.

Trade value

A first-round pick and interesting prospects

Best fits

DORIAN FINNEY-SMITH

Another one of those players who is a tailor-made fit as a deadline acquisition. He doesn't command a significant number of touches. He makes shots from 3, having already hit 42.2 percent from distance this season and 37.3 percent from 3 since 2019-20 on over 1,800 attempts. Finney-Smith is also a versatile defender. He's not quite as good as he was back when he was in his mid-to-late 20s with Dallas, but he's a plus there and still very long and competes at a high level on that end.Any team in need of an influx of shooting and defense — and many of them could use such a skill set contained in just one player's toolbox — would be interested.

Finney-Smith makes $14.9 million and has a player option for $15.4 million next year that will be an interesting decision. Does he try to maximize for another year or decline and get a deal for the longer term? Based on how he's playing so far, I think he should probably decline it, which means the Nets would do very well to move him before the deadline. He feels like one of the most likely players to be dealt.


Trade value

Late first-rounder or multiple good second-rounders

Best fits

Lakers, 76ers, Pacers



DAY’RON SHARPE 

Sharpe missed the first 21 games of the year with a strained hamstring, but he's back now and working his way into action. Last season, as a bench big, he was among the more productive in the league, averaging 6.8 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.4 assists in just 15 minutes per night. He's a monster rebounder but also has a bit more skill and footwork than initially meets the eye. At 23, he has the look of a long-term backup big in the NBA with some starting upside in a pinch down the road if things break right with his development on the defensive end. So given that, why would a rebuilding Nets team be looking to trade him? He's a restricted free agent this summer, and the team just signed Nic Claxton to a nine-figure deal last year. I don't know that I would want to necessarily stick around if I were Sharpe. I also don't know that I'd necessarily want to pay Sharpe if I were Brooklyn, even if the price shouldn't be outrageous. A couple of second-round picks seem like a reasonable price point for everyone. He could end up proving himself a useful backup big man this year.

Trade value

Second-rounders

Best fits

Lakers, Pelicans, Thunder, Nuggets, Wizards



BEN SIMMONS 


Simmons is here purely because he's finally on an expiring contract now that his rookie-scale max contract has run its course. Simmons makes $40.3 million this season and obviously would only be moved if the Nets decided that they wanted to spring a deal for a star player. Simmons has played 19 games this year and is getting 24 minutes per night. He's averaging 5.1 points but also getting 5.6 rebounds and dishing out 6.5 assists. The Nets play him as a sort of makeshift point center who grabs and goes on the break and takes advantage of odd-man opportunities. This has been my sort of dream role for Simmons going back to his later days in Philadelphia, idealizing the theory of becoming a modern Draymond Green-style forward. Simmons is switchable, but I don't think he necessarily seems to love dealing with bigs on the block in the way Green does. He also doesn't seem to have enough confidence as a scorer. But if the Nets don't move him at the deadline because his price tag is too high, I'd be somewhat intrigued by him as a buyout candidate for a defense-needy team if he'd be willing to come in and play a role off the bench. He's had real flashes on defense this year, flying around in space and sliding to cut off drives against wings.

GoNets,3x scoring champ James Harden could be a Brooklyn Net in three days!,"TL;DR Farbod Esnaashari said a Harden-Nets trade would be announced November 22, and there is reason to believe the trade details are actively being figured out this week.

Last weekend, Farbod Esnaashari broke the news that James Harden to the Nets was a “real possibility” and “practically a done deal”. 

In addition to Farbod, Anthony Puccio made his own report this week saying that there is a verbal agreement between the Nets and Rockets.

These reports are still out there, but it has been a discouraging few days if you want the trade to happen. Houston is saying they’re willing to get “uncomfortable” with Harden (and Westbrook). Woj said it’s most likely that Harden starts training camp in Houston. Also, the Rockets are still the favorite to roster Harden at the start of the season as of two days ago on Odds Shark.

Harden is not a Brooklyn Net right now, and may never end up becoming one, but I think there’s still juice to Farbod and Pooch‘s reports that a deal will happen. Neither of their reports have been disproven.

Farbod’s original report said that the “little details” still needed to be ironed out, but if finalized, the trade would be announced on NOVEMBER 22ND. That’s three days from now.

Houston may have changed their stance on Harden since Farbod and Pooch got intel from their respective sources, but I think what’s most likely happening is the details are still being discussed and Harden ends up in Brooklyn.

I’m not an NBA insider so I don’t know what the Rockets are asking the Nets for and what the Nets have offered, but if the trade is still alive, I would bet that the Rockets are figuring out how to best set themselves up in a post Harden era. It seems that all the key contributors in Houston (Harden, Westbrook, Tucker, Gordon) are unhappy and/or want out. Covington is already gone and Austin Rivers opted out. Do the Rockets try to remain relevant and competitive this season, or do they tank?

James Harden could publicly request a trade one night, but that doesn’t mean the Rockets can trade him away that same night. They’re likely figuring out a gameplan. Do the Rockets want 3 or 4 immediate starters from the Nets plus picks, or would they prefer less players, but a motherload of picks? 

Other teams can enter the fold and move their picks to Houston to take on any of LeVert, Dinwiddie, Allen, Prince, etc. if Houston doesn’t want them.

The Rockets understandably want a significant return if they trade away James Harden, even if no return can equate to losing a superstar. I’m sure they want a sizable return for Westbrook as well, given they traded away future assets for him.

The Nets spent this week cutting salary and luxury tax, and added two guards to an already crowded guard rotation. Joe Harris also still needs to be re-signed. Something has to give there.

The Rockets also made moves this week trading away players to acquire first round picks and to cut salary of their own. Both teams’ moves may make sense even if a Harden trade doesn’t happen, but they feel like a precursor to bigger moves.

The Nets may not get James Harden on Sunday, and they may not end up getting him at all, but I don’t think a trade not happening yet nor the NBA Draft passing means that Harden won’t be a Net.

The Nets will contend regardless of roster construction this season, and I understand the fanbase that doesn’t want the Nets to break up their core. I just think acquiring Harden raises both the Nets’ floor and their ceiling. James Harden and Kevin Durant would be one of the best duos in the history of basketball.

wnba,How Liberty mascot Ellie became a Telfar bag-carrying WNBA fashion icon with two stylists,"The New York Liberty’s mascot is turning the tunnel walk into her own runway.

Ellie the Elephant was already famous for twerking, doing the Ashanti scoot and snapping her braids during games, set to the music of Mary J. Blige or Lil’ Kim. But this season, she’s been in a fashion league of her own, delighting her 160,000 TikTok followers with extremely sassy “get ready with me” videos and showing up to games in exclusive designer gear.

Like a proper celebrity, Ellie has her own stylist — two of them, in fact, Criscia Long and Shenay Rivers, known as her “aunties” on social media.

For the first Barclays Center home game back in May, they dressed Ellie in a turquoise Liberty jersey dress from luxury sportswear label Rare Breed BX and a Telfar x UGG shearling-lined suede bag. 

Fans flipped out at the sight of the sashaying mascot carrying the $420 bag. “That’s when we really knew, ‘Wait, we’re doing something bigger than we’ve ever imagined,’” Long said.

Now, designers are lining up to work with Ellie, proving that brand deals are not just for the athletes. 

New York-based artist Nina Chanel Abney — who has a partnership with Nike’s Air Jordan – chose Ellie as her muse, outfitting the pachyderm in a custom Liberty Jordan jersey dress with turquoise Jordan sneakers. 

But Long and Rivers also shop for looks for Ellie off the rack, sometimes at stores like H&amp;M or Forever 21, then work with costume manager Alexis Leatherwood to bedazzle the clothes with studs and rhinestones.

There are unique challenges — like altering pants to fit a tail. 

“At game days we have a costume manager organizing the clothes. The costume originally wasn’t made for this. We’re maneuvering hair and costumes in ways where it has to work for a performer to get out there and perform,” Long said.

Shana Stephenson, chief brand officer for the New York Liberty, told The Post the team thinks of Ellie as an influencer when negotiating brand deals and partnerships.

“We created a rate card specifically for Ellie. We recognize the opportunity and monetization of Ellie as a New York Liberty asset,” Stephenson said. “We do turn down some opportunities.

“Brands are constantly coming to us. Ellie is viewed very much as a social media influencer, and, the same way influencers are compensated for making certain posts, that’s a route we’ve explored with Ellie as well.”",73,9,2024-08-27,https://reddit.com/r/wnba/comments/1f2k9y2/how_liberty_mascot_ellie_became_a_telfar/
GoNets,Video Breakdown: James Harden's Bench Unit,"What's up guys. Some of you might remember I did a fair bit of video work on this sub last season. I'm starting to do that once more across NBA subreddits, but I've been publishing BK-specific  content frequently over at Nets Republic, a great blog-site for Nets coverage (Twitter: LucasKaplan\_NBA). Anyway, sorry for the promo, let's get into it.

Of all the wonderful tidbits the Nets-Clippers game produced last night, one that stood out to me was the production of the Nets bench unit, led by James Harden. Typically, Coach Nash has been running out a Harden/Harris/Green to anchor lineups with two of Brown/TLC/Perry. Last night, though, he kept Harden/Harris in with Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, and DeAndre Jordan, with positive results:

[**Shamet x Harden**](https://streamable.com/ktwqpf)

The Nets have loved using Joe Harris as a screener for James Harden. Last night, they used Shamet in that role. Above, you can see how defenses have problems with a dynamic shooter screening for James Harden. First, Shamet slips the screen amid some Clipper confusion for a wide open lay-up. Lou Williams, in his pursuit to deny Harden the ball, doesn't realize Batum is desperately trying to switch him off the Beard. Next time down the floor, the Nets run the same action. Batum does his best to chase Harden around two screens, but he gets a good look at a 3 anyway.

[**On-ball**](https://streamable.com/pbghq4)

Here, Shamet sets a ball-screen early in the shot clock for Harden, on an open side of the floor. The Clippers are screwed immediately. They can't possibly switch Lou Williams onto Harden, and by the time PG gets there, Shamet's already darted to the arc for an open 3. Playing Harris and Shamet with Harden creates a dynamic where the Nets can use a shooter to screen, and use the other to space the floor.

[**Ball movement**](https://streamable.com/hsca7g) 

This line-up also puts three great shooters with varying ball-handling ability on the perimeter together. This is easy offense. Again, Shamet screens for Harden. Off that action, he and Harris beat the defenders and scramble the defense, allowing Harden to attack a long close-out from PG. Harris and Shamet don't have to be world-beaters off the dribble; they certainly can handle enough to create these sorts of advantages. 

[**On defense,**](https://streamable.com/dfwvgv)

the Nets were switching 1-4, with Jordan in drop coverage, leaving them susceptible to mid-range jump shooters like Lou Will. But, having

[**Bruce Brown**](https://streamable.com/j6phd4)

on the floor, guarding the other team's best player, can shore up that weak spot. He's a bulldog getting over screens and pressure ball-handlers. Offensively, though, Brown can 

[**Clog the lane**](https://streamable.com/1o7yde)

when Harden and DJ are running pick n' rolls. Above, his defender, Marcus Morris, cheats off him, all the way under the basket, and disrupts and lob to Jordan. No matter how deadly the other three players are, having two non-threats from the perimeter will hamstring an offense from time-to-time. An unorthodox move to combat this that we've seen in recent games, though, is the Nets using  

[**Brown as a roller**](https://streamable.com/big7ne)**.**

Taking DJ off the court allows the Nets to switch every ball-screen on defense, and still use a rim-diver to screen for Harden. Brown has been great finishing in the paint this year, and here, he makes a nice pass after Harden gets doubled, leading to an open 3. KD is on the floor here, but it's easy to imagine Shamet in his place. I'd be interesting in seeing if the Nets do run a Harden-Shamet-Brown-Harris-Green five vs. bench units on nights when Green doesn't start.",73,6,2021-02-04,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/lc5q9d/video_breakdown_james_hardens_bench_unit/

GoNets,All of the important things said during the 2025 Brooklyn Nets Draft Class Introductory Press Conference,"Comments from Sean Marks:

- Sean Marks specifically mentioned that while Best Player Available was a factor in each draft pick, they were looking for versatility and flexibility so there's no limits to how these guys play.
- Sean Marks says the Brooklyn and Long Island Nets will continue to have communication with each other so when guys are sent to Long Island, they don't miss anything and so they can continue to see guys take leaps and play meaningful minutes when they return back to Brooklyn. They want to foster a competitive environment to bring the best out of these guys.
- Sean Marks says the connection between him, Jordi and the coaching staff is important not only for drafting but for Free Agency and Trades. They want to always figure out how each and every player may fit within the team before making decisions. 
- Sean Marks says the expectation is to compete and there will be no limit on what the team does. They will not lose a certain amount of games or make any decisions like that. They will compete.
- Sean gives a lot of credit to the scouting team for helping him lay eyes on all the guys they've drafted. The scouting team played a big part of identifying these guys and figuring out how they'd fit with the team. We should expect to see a big rise in their development quick but there will be a learning curve. He emphasized that we need to all remember they're 19. 

Comments from Coach Jordi:

- Jordi: ""We want to play w/ pace. In my opinion we have the fastest guy in the draft. We have a lot of playmaking. All these guys can really pass...it helps when you have not just primarily ballhandlers but also secondary ballhandlers &amp; all these guys can do it.""

- Jordi: ""I'm starting with defense. Positional size is very important, right? And you guys can see here, with your eye test, I would play these guys almost, you know, one-through-four, one through-five. So that's a good thing for us. You'll see length, athleticism, and we'll keep working on that physicality, communication.""

- Jordi on why the Nets were so excited to draft Egor Demin: “His positional size and his playmaking. Obviously, it’s very important that we help each other and we give each other the best shot possible, and we believe that he can do it. Whether playing pick and roll or simply making the right play. That’s who he is, and if you watch him play and you get to know him, you can see that right away. His ability to shoot the ball. He’s gonna shoot the ball very well in this league. That is another thing that excites us. But also his work ethic. We know he’s gonna show up, he’s gonna work every day. That’s something that caught our eye. Because as you know, it’s not just watching them play real games, but we know a lot about these guys. That’s what you do through the process. Like Sean said, the coaches who were a part of the process were amazing. The group did an amazing job and us [coaches] being involved in it was very unique for me from my experience. And selecting Egor, another thing that I believe he’s gonna help us with is his fullcourt pace. His ability to throw the ball ahead, that’s also gonna help the team. We were pretty fast in the halfcourt and slow in the fullcourt, and I think he’s gonna help us be faster in the fullcourt.”

- Jordi said it will ""be on him"" to figure out how to get the five Nets rookies minutes and aid their development. Added that he'll likely have a 10-man rotation next season.

Comments from Egor, Nolan, Drake, Ben and Danny:

- The young guys all say they're excited to get to know each other but for Summer League and the preseason as well. They're ready to start on the right foot and build chemistry with one another. 
- Egor says his name is Yay-gor Deh-men (pronunciation wise). Egor believes the Nets is a really good fit for them and they can be a really fast paced team. He wants to rebound, find someone in front of him and outlet as quick as possible. And he wants to do whatever coach needs him to do.
- Egor Demin says he did in fact speak to Andrei Kirilenko as it was important to his parents. AK called him the next day after being drafted to the Nets and AK gave him advice. He also told Egor he was really happy he landed with the Nets.
- Egor is ready to be whatever position the Nets need to him to be. His role is to learn whatever the Nets need him to be off and on the ball as that's part of his development. He doesn't view himself as any particular role.
- Egor Demin got a lot of chuckles, saying ""I believe we can really find good offensive and defensive variety ... There's going to be rotations where we just switch everything,"" Then looks around to Jordi and Sean and says, ""Well, it's not my decision anymore.""
- Nolan says he's already started to work with the Nets and he is excited for the journey. He also likes the city, lol. Sean enjoyed watching Nolan play live and in person because you saw his speed, breaking down defenses and he found him really exciting. He also loved getting to know Nolan because he's a quiet leader and he saw the respect Nolan got from his older teammate. 
- Drake Powell says he's gonna make an immediate impact and do whatever he can to the best of his ability to help with the team's defense.
- Sean says Ben Saraf's pride on defense, finishing around the basketball and not shying away from contact is what inspired them to draft him. As for Danny Wolf, it was his IQ and size that inspired the team to draft them. Ben Saraf says the Jewish community has already shown him a lot of love and excitement, which he really appreciated. 
- Sean is excited to have Ben and Danny as they're great ambassadors for the Jewish Community.
- Drake says his everyday preparation allowed him to put trust in his vets as he just tried to shadow them. That preparation is what'll let him be ready for his time with the Nets.

Then, it suddenly ended lol",72,74,2025-07-01,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1lp88sm/all_of_the_important_things_said_during_the_2025/
GoNets,That was some really classy stuff LBJ did today. Gotta reflect on that.,"I said earlier today there's only two names I've ever worn on my back.  That's 42 Brooklyn and 21 Pittsburgh, Robinson and Clemente, because they were more than just athletes, but wanted to change the world.  Today LeBron joined that group.  Watching what LeBron did today, can't lie, I got a little choked up.  We all have those issues that we have a soft spot for.  For me it's immigrant rights, single moms and education for disadvantaged youth.  Hate to steal LeBron's ""I'm not supposed to be here"" but I have several family members who saw more of a future in the streets than in schools, and you know the stories of how that goes.  I sometimes think, damn, I'm not doing Nike commercials but I'm doing okay.  Not in jail, not dead.  Thank God.  How did that fate skip me?  My parents were very strict about education, and maybe that's why I felt especially touched today.  

Obviously we all don't have the resources to open schools, but we can contribute in however small way we can.  It's not a handout but an investment in society.  

Let's not forget our own Spencer Dinwiddie.  He may not have the name recognition of LeBron but he's doing the most he can with his platform and the Dinwiddie Family Foundation.

I told him and myself, and now I'm telling you folks, I'd get involved in it but haven't done so yet.  So that's in my August plans.  I""ve now told the world, so now I gotta come through.

GoNets,"[Brooklyn Nets] This could be their starting lineup. Irving, Harris, LeVert, Durant, Allen.","https://preview.redd.it/4xwyk99fz5731.jpg?width=3205&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f33132b651a8747f05d6367be17a0d5acf8b3aa

This of course would be a dream scenario, but would this team be enough to conquer the East?  
We really exceeded expectations with a team full of young and developing players, and if we make   
these acquisitions plus other minor tweaks. It would be awesome and another step in the right direction.  


There are many moving pieces to this puzzle and these situations will have to go according to plan

* \[**Irving** has to focus on actual basketball and not be distracted by the media\]
* \[**Harris** needs to forget about this past playoff performance and continue his regular season form\]
* \[**LeVert** has to stay healthy and continue being aggressive on the offensive end\]
* \[**Durant** will have to modify his approach due to his achilles injury\]
* \[**Allen** continues to improve on the defensive end, while adding muscle to his frame and maybe   
adds a mid-range jumper\]

&amp;#x200B;

**Their bench is a strength and one of the deepest in the NBA. They were top 5 in** ***MPG*****,** ***PPG*****,** ***Net Rating***

* **Dinwiddie** will lead the second team and at times will lead the first team if Irving misses a game   
\[*which will be the case, the Nets are careful with injuries and will rather lose games than a player for the year*\]. 
* The addition of **Tearuan Prince** is an underrated one, in my opinion they knew that Carroll was not resigning with them so they traded for a player who was selected in the lottery and also has similar   
traits but is 7 years younger. A stretch 3 with the ability to cover multiple positions and bang inside.  
They gave up their 1st rounder this year for him, only to get a 2020 back by trading back in the draft.
* **Rodion Kurucs** displayed glimpses on both ends of the floor last year and needs to become more comfortable being in uncomfortable positions. His 3 point shooting in the playoffs (25%) slipped from   
the regular season (31.5%) and at times was out of position versus Philadelphia. This is natural for a rookie, he'll need to put in the work this summer. He the tools and attitude to be part of this team for a long time.
* A prediction is that I believe they will keep **Jared Dudley**, the spokesman of the team.
* **Napier** will be signed for another year unless another they decide to move him. He could be valuable   
on a team that lacks point guard depth and experience \[for example the Suns\]. A capable scorer and   
proved that when Dinwiddie was out with his hurt thumb.
* Players battling for minutes but will eventually see the floor because of rest or injuries will be   
**Treveon Graham**, **Theo Pinson**, **Alan Williams**, **Jaylen Hands**. Let's hope Pinson goes   
swimming this year, and keeps the bench energy going. It's vital to the team culture.
* I do think there will be some early surprises next year like **Dzanan Musa** and **Nic Claxton** earning   
minutes. As we've learned with Rodi, Atkinson is not afraid to plug in young players into the game   
if they put in the work and if they are ready to contribute by any means necessary. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Departures and good-byes**

* They will miss Mr. Swag’s \[**Demarre Carroll**\] leadership and offensive savviness that bailed them out of many lost possessions by getting to the free throw line. 
* **Ed Davis** will most likely leave as well, and is easily one of the most efficient players in the league.   
If they resign him, it will be a huge accomplishment by the organization.
* **D'Angelo Russell** will most likely be on another team which honestly makes me a little sad.   
I have watched every Nets game for the past couple of seasons and I've seen his development   
since he first arrived from Los Angeles. His decision making has accelerated but the time on the   
court has slowed down in his mind, he is now seeing a couple plays ahead. From outcast to all-star,   
DLO deserves the money he is inevitably going to receive from whichever team offers it. I'll always remember watching the Kings game this year where he went full DLOADING and basically showed the whole NBA they were wrong about him.
* **Rondae-Hollis-Jefferson** Going back to the Kings game where RHJ got the unorthodox game winner, this play symbolizes who he is as a player. Tough, gritty and willing to do whatever it takes for the team.  
He's an OG Net, and has stuck it out with them. I was so happy when they made the playoffs in his last year here. He still has ways to go on the offensive end but I believe he’ll eventually knock down that 3 pointer consistently. A team that needs a versatile defender and glue guy will take a shot with RHJ. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I haven’t been this excited for the Nets free agency since we got Vince Carter** 

* \[The trade for Pierce + Garnett wasn’t that exciting knowing their age would limit our window\] 
* \[Deron Williams was a little exciting but I worried about his ankles holding up\] 
* \[Joe Johnson was awesome but it was later in his career, would of been more excited   
if it was in his early Atlanta days\] 

&amp;#x200B;

**Expectations**

There will be many questions about this team, as there are for every other team in the NBA but these Nets came from the mud and are now here to compete in the East once again. If they do acquire Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant it'll be the first time since the Jason Kidd, Richard Jefferson, Kenyon Martin days where we had stars in their prime ready to take that leap once again. What does everyone think? Will they be contenders,   
will it not even happen, or will it happen and not go as planned?

GoNets,TIL: Kyrie Irving is the NBA’s second-leading sneaker salesman behind only LeBron James,"From a feature on how Kyrie Irving is ""in the absolute epicenter"" of basketball sneaker culture [in The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/1433512/2019/12/05/from-wheaties-to-spongebob-how-kyrie-irvings-shoe-designs-took-over-the-basketball-world/?source=dailyemail):

&gt;In the middle of an on-court scuffle between the Nets and Knicks on Oct. 25, Kyrie Irving and Bobby Portis were going at it when YES Network commentator and former NBA player Richard Jefferson made an observation.  
&gt;  
&gt;“(Irving)’s fighting someone that’s wearing his shoes,” Jefferson said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Portis, sporting a pair of Kyrie Low 2s from Nike, tried to rip the ball out of Irving’s hands on a play Irving presumed was blown dead. It wasn’t the first time an Irving opponent was wearing his signature sneakers, a version of which retails for about $110. Pay attention to players’ feet next time you watch any NBA game — odds are you’ll see multiple players wearing a pair of Kyries, including stars like Luka Doncic, Ja Morant and Jrue Holiday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Considered an innovator among athletes for his outside-the-box design inspirations, Irving is quickly becoming a cult hero in the sneaker world for players and sneakerheads alike. He made $11 million from the company during the last fiscal year, according to Forbes. At the end of the 2017-18 season, Irving was the NBA’s second-leading sneaker salesman behind only LeBron James, according to the NPD Group, which tracks retail industry trends.  
&gt;  
&gt;“He’s in the absolute epicenter of basketball culture,” said Matt Powell, a sports retail analyst for NPD Group. “And LeBron, who would have been the leader, is now (playing) in a market that doesn’t care about basketball shoes.”

I follow the NBA really closely, but can't tell you the first thing about sneakerhead culture, so this was a pretty educational read.",68,17,2019-12-05,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/e6jpur/til_kyrie_irving_is_the_nbas_secondleading/

Spence Dinwiddie is legit. Jarrett Allen can freaking ball (can’t believe the kid is 19), the skill and effort were there but he was just a bit passive, then again he’s a teen two years away from legally drinking... He’ll definitely get better with more experience and will be a monster in 5 years. Caris levert is pretty good (didn’t have the best game tonight). And good lord that man Rondae Hollis Jefferson aka Tupac can ball.

wnba,Julie Vanloo’s wild week after Valkyries move reflects WNBA has issues to fix,"Bruce Jenkins piece from the SF Chronicle.  Sorry, I'm out of actual gift links for the month but will excerpt a bit of the story here.  Perhaps another subscriber can add gift link to access entire piece.  I think he makes a number of good points

&gt;The [Golden State Valkyries](https://www.sfchronicle.com/valkyries/) broke a good woman’s heart this week, and they hated to see it go down that way, but the recovery process was swift and efficient for all concerned. Things move awfully fast in the WNBA, and this episode was a clear sign that the league’s roster limit needs a makeover.

&gt;In any sport, expansion teams tend to be a ragtag bunch of vagabonds, thrown together in desperation and bound to spend a few years viewing life from the basement. The Valkyries wouldn’t hear of it. Sorting through the other teams’ excess and venturing boldly into the international market, [they crafted an instant success story](https://www.sfchronicle.com/sports/article/valkyries-instant-hit-success-story-painted-20394544.php) that has left the entire league in awe — not just on the court but in attendance, marketing strategy and revenue streams.

&gt;In many ways, [Julie Vanloo](https://www.sfchronicle.com/julie-vanloo/) represented the Valkyries’ appeal: clever and athletic, with a gift for showmanship and, on the best nights, the 3-point shot. But things got crowded in the team’s backcourt, so much so that when a talented veteran player, Aerial Powers, was signed as a fill-in for players competing in the Eurobasket tournament overseas, she basically just cheered from the bench for two weeks.

&gt;[Veronica Burton](https://www.sfchronicle.com/veronica-burton/), [Tiffany Hayes](https://www.sfchronicle.com/tiffany-hayes/) and [Kate Martin](https://www.sfchronicle.com/kate-martin/) made it clear they’d be here to stay. Fans couldn’t wait to see the exciting [Carla Leite](https://www.sfchronicle.com/carla-leite/) return from injury. [Kaitlyn Chen](https://www.sfchronicle.com/kaitlyn-chen/), a starter on UConn’s national championship team last year, bounced on and off the roster. All of which led to a disheartening conclusion for coach [Natalie Nakase](https://www.sfchronicle.com/natalie-nakase/): There was no room for the 32-year-old Vanloo, who hadn’t been playing particularly well and missed out on the club’s recent rise through the standings.

&gt;This is where it became awkward and inexcusable that the WNBA limits rosters to 12 players — 11 in some cases, due to salary-cap restrictions. “I mean, what is that?” WNBA legend Candace Parker told reporters. “You can’t even practice with 11.”

&gt;For various reasons, a number of excellent, well-known players have found themselves waived or released in recent days, among them DeWanna Bonner, Grace Berger, Tiffany Mitchell, Elizabeth Kitley and Haley Jones. Some will resurface, others might be rethinking their future.

&gt;It’s the Valkyries, however, who most demonstrate why the rosters must expand to 15 players. Were you that familiar with Burton, [Kayla Thornton](https://www.sfchronicle.com/kayla-thornton/), [Temi Fagbenle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/temi-fagbenle/) or [Monique Billings](https://www.sfchronicle.com/monique-billings/) before the season started? They’ve all become mainstays in the league. Golden State saw a vision of the future — international stars increasingly passionate about leaving home — and astutely acquired Leite, [Janelle Salaün](https://www.sfchronicle.com/janelle-salaun/), [Cecilia Zandalasini](https://www.sfchronicle.com/cecilia-zandalasini/), [Iliana Rupert](https://www.sfchronicle.com/iliana-rupert/) and Lithuania’s 19-year-old [Juste Jocyte](https://www.sfchronicle.com/juste-jocyte/), who will join the team next year and has all the makings of a backcourt starter.Vanloo was in that group, [until she wasn’t](https://www.sfchronicle.com/sports/article/waiving-julie-vanloo-valkyries-talk-breaking-20417466.php), but she rebounded like a champ. Immediately picked up by Los Angeles, she needed 48 hours to clear waivers — and she was determined  to show up for the Sparks’ game in Brooklyn on Thursday night. So there she was, standing outside Barclays Center with her baggage, waiting to become officially eligible at 5 p.m. 

&gt;Some three hours later, in a lovely gesture by Sparks coach Lynne Roberts, Vanloo was on the court against the New York Liberty, given two minutes of get-acquainted playing time. Now she’s on another stacked roster including Kelsey Plum, Dearica Hamby, Rickea Jackson, Azura Stevens, Rae Burrell, rookie guard Sarah Ashley Barker and Julie Allemand, a longtime friend and teammate on Belgium’s national team, with former Stanford star Cameron Brink soon to return from knee surgery.

&gt;“Anything for the dream,” Vanloo told reporters after the game. “I’m not here to throw stones at Golden State. I come from a family where we don’t sit around and be petty about things, we just keep going.”

GoNets,Watching the Redeem Team on Netflix and the Giants this season was a reminder on the importance of a good coach,"Larry Brown had a team of Duncan, AI, Lebron, Wade and Carmelo and still couldn't beat Puerto Rico. Some of those guys were young but still. To win, they needed proper roster construction and the right coach. 

The Nets had too many small guards last season and arguably the wrong coach. I've stated multiple times before that Nash like Kidd will probably end up as a good coach one day, but needs time and experience. When Harden, KD and Kyrie all have no confidence in Nash, to the point of wanting out, that's saying something. 

Have you guys seen what's going on with the Giants? They just beat Green Bay with essentially a practice squad. Daboll has had a night and day impact on the team. They didn't add anyone of significance this year, is struggling with injuries, but are already 4-1. Is Nash like a Joe Judge?

GoNets,ben simmons return,"An alarm rings. A large figure slowly emerges from beneath satin sheets, thread count of 2600. A deep voice- youthful, strong, yet soulless, reverbs off his walls.

""Siri, what day is it mate?""

""The date is April 25""

A wave of anxiety washes over the man. He proceeds to his bathroom with long calculated strides. His hands tremble in anticipation of what's to come as he pulls out his Johnson from his silk boxers. Doubt creeps in as he takes aim. Then the shame. He's done this a million times before. Why is today so different? So hard?

Aware of every breath he takes, cognizant of every passing and fanciful thought, he gets the sense he is alive.

He releases a strong healthy stream of urine, accumulated from hours of slumber. Not fully awake and unsteady, he paints the rim and the surrounding laminate marble tiles with a fresh coat of liquid gold.

""Hmm... progress.""

Getting through the rest of his morning routine without much incident calms his nerves, if only just a little.

The rest of the day is a blur. The next thing he remembers is his arrival at the Garden. Still unfamiliar and uncomfortable in these new circumstances, his walk slows to a sedated pace.

In the locker room his teammates are getting taped up and ready for today's game. There is an energy in the air. Electric- fully charged by a conglomerate of his motivated, testesterone filled acquaintances.

A raspy voice brings him back to reality.

""Why so late Ben?""

Ben's gaze meets Nash's lazy eye. Still unsure which one to look at, he looks down, fixated on the floor he replies curtly,

""Therapy.""

""Right.""

At his locker rests his jersey in black and white. Devoid of emotion, he strips skyclad, his well toned body, flawless skin and imposing physique highlighted by fluorescent lights, he puts on his new identity. A Brooklyn Net.

The raspy voice pierces the atmosphere again. It's time for warmups.

Walking out of the tunnel, Ben braces himself emotionally. His thoughts wander to Kyrie and the wisdom Uncle Drew generously offered him earlier in the month. Don't fucking listen to the haters. They're pawns, simpletons, meaningless organisms  wandering without purpose in this illusionary world. It isn't real. This isn't real. Nothing is real.

Ben's lips give birth to a sly smirk. Nothing the crowd says today will hurt him. Sticks and stones. A wave of confidence and resolve overtakes him.

I will show them.

His meek stroll transforms into energetic strides. As he materializes from the tunnel, the boos rain in the nanosecond the photons from the arena lights bounces from his frame into the spectators' eyes. He hears nothing.

Having now integrated himself into the Net's shooting warmups, a ball boy directs a bounce pass straight to Ben. Caressing Wilson's leather, malicious voices begin to penetrate the mental barrier he had erected not even a minute ago.

""He won't even shoot in warmups, the fucking pussy!""

""Let me diagnose you with my cock, Ben!""

""$10,000 dollars you airball RIGHT NOW BEN!""

I'll prove them wrong.

Ben takes a rhythm dribble and squares up. He rises for the shot with certainty. His feet set, torso and limbs employed in perfect harmony. The ball leaves his fingertips. Watching the ball glide through the air, he knows this one is pure. The trajectory and velocity are flawless. Wrist as a goose's neck that would make a 90's Bulls fan jealous, he eagerly waits for the ball to swish through the net.

""Get that weak shit outta here!""

Blake Griffin punches the shot away from under as the ball descends just past the front rim. He points and laughs at Ben.

""Just a prank bro! LOL!""

Ben feels hell's heat permeate his cheeks. Who the fuck actually verbally says ""lol""? And that shot was money. It would take him months, if not years to get a shot as true as the one he had just so meaningfully assembled.

Mind reeling from this great injustice, he slips into the dark depths of his mind once again. Maybe it was never meant to be. Maybe I will never make a three pointer like everybody says. Maybe, I'm not good enough. His world fades to black.

TWEET ""8 seconds. Celtic’s ball""

Brought back to his senses, Ben takes in his surroundings and realizes the game has started. He looks up to the scoreboard. It reads 0-0, Q1 11:52.

""What the fuck Ben? Wake the fuck up cunt!"" shrieks Patty Mills as he claps in Simmons' face.

He situates himself at the top of the key, eyeing Jayson Tatum as he struts himself and the ball past halfcourt. As he dribbles for the 18th time between his legs, instincts take over and he reaches out for the ball. His hands touch leather, and the ball is once again liberated from Tatum’s tyranny, rolling blissfully towards half court. Simmons bursts towards it, scooping it up easily with his great length and capable hands.

He accelerates to the other end, a lifetime of experience and a wealth of talent about to manifest into an unforgettable moment. As he nears the goal, a tall, dark, familiar fearsome figure stands ready. Timelord is already in position to protect the rim, ready to stop him by any means necessary.

Having second thoughts, Simmons pulls back and waits for his squad to set up in the half court. The crowd starts to jeer and boo and the crowd starts to chant...

""Fuck Ben Simmons!""

Clap clap, clapclapclap

""Fuck Ben Simmons!""

Clap clap, clapclapclap

He swings the ball to Durant. Struggling with himself in this moment, he attempts to drown the nagging, persistent thoughts of inadequacy by rationalizing, I'm the facilitator. I can't be selfish. I'm NOT a pussy.

The Slim Reaper is swiftly doubled, and the ball finds itself back in Simmons' hands. He surveys the floor. Timelord is on the weakside, a full step away from the paint. The only obstacle between him and the basket is a pudgy beard.

Ben begins his dribble. The noise fades away. His focus steeled and centered to the rim. He brings the ball to his right, then hesitates, then explodes back to his left. Marcus Smart, in a feeble attempt to maintain his facade of giving an effort on defense, raises his arm while his feet remain fastened to the hardwood and hits Ben across the shoulder.

No whistle

Timelord reacts swiftly, moving with purpose to defend the rim at all costs. Simmons sees him coming, but it does not matter. Not one bit.

Ben gathers the ball, takes three legal powerful steps and takes flight...

wnba,Clara Wu Tsai’s Plan to Build the First $1 Billion WNBA Franchise,"When Clara Wu Tsai and her husband, Alibaba co-founder Joe Tsai, bought the WNBA’s New York Liberty in 2019, one of her first priorities was convincing her fellow team owners they needed to spend money to see real growth in the sport.

“For so long, we felt that the owners in the league have been operating from this scarcity mindset and just trying to save money,” Wu Tsai said earlier this week at The Information’s Women in Tech, Media and Finance conference in Yountville, Calif. “But that’s not how you grow.

“We’re spending money in order to grow,” said Wu Tsai, who is the governor of the Liberty and also co-owns the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets with her husband. “That’s a mindset.”

The latest example of the Tsais’ willingness to pump money into the Liberty is a new $80 million practice facility for the team under construction in Brooklyn’s Greenpoint neighborhood. Wu Tsai discussed that investment, the surging valuations of WNBA teams (including her own) and other topics in an interview at the WTF conference conducted by Jessica E. Lessin, the founder and editor in chief of The Information.

**Jessica E. Lessin: I like starting with news. The agreement with the players—the negotiations are continuing, there’s been a \[proposed\] extension. What can you share about that process and what do you hope is the outcome?**

*Clara Wu Tsai: Well, we’re right in the thick of it, so there’s very little that I can say. What I can say is just sort of explain what the \[collective bargaining agreement\] is.…It’s the framework for salaries, benefits and travel standards and basically the working conditions of all the players in the league. It’s essentially the biggest piece of the cost structure of the league. It’s very important.*

*If we get this right…the salaries and the benefits of the players will grow, but at the same time, we’ll be able to have a sustainable model so that teams and the league can be profitable and also scale the business in the way that we’re actually ready for it to scale right now.*

**You said you want to build the first billion-dollar WNBA team. What does it take to get from here to there?**

*First of all, it’s going to be a lot easier to get from $450 \[million\] to a billion than \[it was to get\] from zero to $450 \[million\].*

**And $450 \[million\] is the most recent valuation, right?**

*Yeah. What it takes is just a continued trajectory of growth. We’re very positive that that’s going to happen. In fact, I actually think there might be more than one WNBA team who actually reaches a billion-dollar valuation in the next five to 10 years. It’s obviously based on revenues. We look at the trajectory of revenues, and for the last three to four years, we’ve been growing revenues on the order of 20% to 80% on all the key metrics. We fully expect all of that to continue.*

*What makes the WNBA exciting is there’s a lot of room for monetization because the revenues haven’t caught up with the viewership. When you look at national broadcast viewership of the WNBA, it’s about 30% that of the NBA. But when you look at the percent that the WNBA has of the media deal, we’re 2%. Even when the new deal kicks in, we’ll be 4% of it. If we grow to some sort of parity on sponsorships and media, on a per-viewer basis, we could easily double our revenues, which would also mean that we would double our valuation.*

*On the team level, it’s really important that we also start to price at market value. And so an example is sponsorships. We’ve now set some sponsorship floors and some minimums, and we’re just aligning with partners who have the scale and also the ambition to grow with us. We’re doing the same thing on ticketing, especially for our courtside and our premium seat holders. We’ve actually improved the entertainment a lot, and we’ve improved our \[food and beverage\]. But we haven’t raised prices. It’s now time to align pricing with the value that we’re providing.*

**Why did you buy the team?**

*In 2019, we bought the Brooklyn Nets and the Barclays Center. In 2017, the previous owner of the Liberty put it up for sale and then got a little impatient, and in 2018, \[they\] moved them to play at Westchester County Center from Madison Square Garden. That wasn’t a good look for the league. It made the league really nervous.*

*The commissioner of the NBA came to us and asked us to take a look because by that point, we’d bought the Brooklyn Nets and we had the arena. It does make sense for the owner of \[the Liberty\] to have an arena, because you need a big stage for these women to play. We took a look and the numbers weren’t good. I would call it a distressed asset in the pure definition of the term. But we saw some good fundamentals.*

*We knew that we were going to lose money because the first thing we did was move them to Barclays Center. They were playing to crowds of 2,000 in Westchester. Barclays sits 18,000. We thought, OK, we’ll lose money, but we just didn’t know for how long.*

*We started to invest in facilities and in player health. And then when the biggest free agent became available in 2023, I went to Turkey to talk to Breanna Stewart. I basically told her that in order for the league to grow in New York, it needed New York to be a strong franchise. I wanted her to join me to just elevate the standards of the league. It worked. She joined us. She brought a couple other stars with her. In four years, we went to the finals for the first time in 20 years, and then in the fifth year, we actually won a championship.*

**Let’s talk about this wild streaming media rights landscape at the moment. How do you take advantage of that, both on the revenue side but also in terms of maximizing viewership?**

*Wu Tsai: I haven’t quite seen \[NBA broadcasts from\] NBC yet. I’ve been really impressed with the game presentation that I’ve seen from Amazon Prime Video, who is one of the new media partners in the new media deal.*

*A little bit less than half of all sports viewership is actually through streaming right now. That’s just streaming on a TV screen. If you actually add streaming on a mobile device or a laptop, the share is even more than that. This is where the next generation of fans lives. The second key piece of information is that streaming has very much closely reached broadcast scale.*

*If you look at football, for example, like Thursday night football on Amazon Prime this year, they set a brand-new record in viewership for a regular season game. They had 18 million viewers on average. When you look at the viewership of NFL games in a regular season for a linear network like a CBS or a Fox, it’s 21 million. It’s very, very close. I think you can say that streaming is not really complementary at this point. It’s a premier destination. It’s at broadcast scale and it has global reach. Just to see the way that Amazon has approached game presentation, they’ve made quite an investment, they paid quite a lot for the rights.*

**What are they doing differently?**

*There are some interesting tech-enabled elements that make the experience more interactive and also more educational. They have an LED regulation half court, and they have former star players like Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash and Udonis Haslem and a few others actually go. They’ll break down defensive plays on this LED court…that’s, like, really bringing you on the inside. The game analysis is really good. They’re layering data and odds for sports betting…on their broadcast as well.*

**What about tech outside the broadcast—are you adopting it for your players, for your fans?**

*In the arena, for sure. When you think about what the future is of sports and entertainment, it’s definitely a friction-free experience. That means biometric entry. It means mobile ordering. It means more personalization. It means real-time data loops and feedback. We implemented face authentication for faster entry, and we’ve upgraded audio and lighting. We introduced haptic devices for the blind.*

**From your perspective, is there too much capital chasing women’s sports? Is there not enough capital chasing women’s sports?**

*There is so much investor demand for women’s sports, but in particular for the WNBA. I think it’s because it’s the most mature women’s professional league right now. It has the best infrastructure, it has great talent, it has a pipeline of talent coming up. People probably see this gap, this monetization potential between the viewership and the revenue.*

*There’s a lot of people who want to get into the league and think of it as a good investment. There will also be scarcity. We’re going to add two teams this year and two more teams after that. By 2030, there’ll be 18 teams in the league. It’ll be kept at that for a little bit because we need to sort of absorb all of that. But as a result of that scarcity, there are a lot of people who want to be in it.*

**What about private equity? We’re seeing that as a big trend. Is that playing out in basketball?**

*Definitely. Maybe two-thirds of the NBA teams have some bit of private equity in it. On the WNBA side, I know there were private equity companies that were part of the expansion bids.*

*I think that private equity has really been transformational for all sports team owners. Because it allows for liquidity…without owners having to relinquish control. Previously, it was really media rights that were propping up valuations in the league. It’s really now private equity that’s…going to cause valuations to stay healthy.*

**You said earlier you knew you were going to lose money for a long time. Are you making money yet?**

*That will always depend on how long your postseason is. We had a bit of an early exit \[this season\]. This is the thing—the profitability is very fragile.  And again, as I said earlier, it’s investment-led growth…the capital investments, like we just announced, building an $80 million, 75,000-square-foot practice facility in Greenpoint. Why? It’s going to be incredible. Why? Because the players deserve it.*

*This is a place where we’re going to fit it out with biomechanics labs. We’re at that point—speaking of AI—where if a player said, ‘I really wanna be known for my hang time, or I wanna dunk, or whatever,’ we could figure out with all the motion capture and AI…and biomechanical data from the video. We could…*

**Make me an NBA player? Probably not.**

*If someone said that’s what they wanted to do, we could tell that person what exercises or what muscles they needed to work in order to actually achieve their goal.*

GoNets,Thank You Nets fans! (Quick trip update).,"Last week I made a post asking for advice on a few things and you guys were all so considerate and welcoming.  Tons of great info and with the help of the search function I was able to do some research and get some relatively good seats for the price (upper corners).

Let me tell you, what an experience.  I’m from Canada and the closest NBA team is 1500 miles away.  I’ve been to a few games in my time (LA, PHX, TOR)  but Barclays was rocking!!
I Love the Brooklyn Vibe with 90s hip hop and I am so glad you guys embrace Jay Z and Biggie.  I saw the banners next to the Canadian flag lol.

I am so amazed by your city and I wish I had more time.  I’ll be back, I didn’t even get to do anything besides the game.  You all had some great suggestions for Pizza and Fried Chicken and I was unable to do either (Sad).
Except for Chicken Fingers at Barclays but that doesn’t count..  I was so overwhelmed I just hopped in a line and got something. Lol

I under estimated how busy and crazy Brooklyn is but I loved every second of it.
Even though you hear how insane it is, you don’t know until you get thrown into it.  We were staying in New Jersey (For work) and I guess I should have asked how the drive is from NJ to Brooklyn lol
We should have just Ubered it.  After the white knuckle drive (Our busiest roads are 2 lanes and you can get anywhere in the city within 25 minutes Lol) and the attempt to find parking.  We were regretting it.  BUT, I think everyone needs to experience it just once.  We did find parking, and it was 75% of the cost of taking an uber….  Maybe the most impressive thing I saw that night was how this parking garage was able to Tetris in 60+ cars into a space that looked like it could fit 20.
 
Anyways I’m rambling.  I’ll be back.  Thank you all, I love your city and most of it I saw from a distance.  You are all very lucky to be a part of such a special place.

- Your new Canadian friend (Nets are now my second favourite team) 🙂",60,2,2024-01-30,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1aeszc0/thank_you_nets_fans_quick_trip_update/

wnba,"LIBERTY, LIBERTY: New York’s WNBA Franchise Signs Jersey Patch Deal","BY JASON CLINKSCALES
May 1, 2025 8:45am

A seemingly natural partnership between brand and team has come to fruition as the WNBA champion New York Liberty signed Liberty Mutual Insurance as their primary jersey sponsor. The insurance company replaces financial securities firm Webull, the previous lower jersey sponsor from 2021 until 2024.

The new patch will appear on the abdomen of each Liberty jersey below the number. While Liberty Mutual is not new to sports marketing, this is the first jersey patch deal in company history. Neither side shared the financial details of the sponsorship, though this is one of the largest partnership deals in the team’s history.

 
Catherine Carlson, the EVP of global partnerships for BSE Global (the Liberty’s ownership group), said that the team had always hoped to build a relationship with the insurer based on having similar brand identities and shared interest in community work. Yet she said it took sustained outreach from BSE’s sales director to make the connection.

“He actually read me back the one-sentence response: ‘We’re huge women’s sports fans on this end, and so excited to see all the excitement around WNBA and women’s sports in general,’” Carlson said of the response in a video interview. “The entire executive team of Liberty Mutual proved to be just as big as New York Liberty fans as we are. In fact, they were actually with us in the suite when the Liberty won the championship this last year.”

In addition to the jersey patch, the well-known characters of both brands will come together often throughout their partnership. Liberty Mutual’s buddy-cop characters Doug and LiMu Emu (an emu) will link up with Ellie the Elephant, the Liberty’s ever-popular mascot, for multiple activations. Doug and LiMu will appear as on-court mascots alongside Ellie and the trio will have frequent interactions for social media. The team’s “celebrity row” at Barclays Center will be rebranded as “Ce-Liberty Row” as well. Liberty Mutual’s insignia will appear on the court, and the seatbacks and kickplates on the team’s bench.

The activations with the three characters may be synergistic for both team and brand, but they also speak to how popular Ellie has become outside of Liberty games. Not since the debut of Gritty, the Philadelphia Flyers’ mascot, has a team’s character organically built a strong presence of its own.

 
Balancing Ellie’s personality and the team’s authenticity with this new commercial opportunity won’t be an issue, Carlson said.

“What’s interesting with brands and the New York Liberty is we’re attracting brands that perhaps haven’t even worked with the WNBA,” she said about Ellie’s popularity. “It’s actually opened the types of industries and the type of brands that we talk to.”

“Ellie became a sensation. People know Liberty Mutual for Doug and LiMu, bringing the two together is actually fun. I think people will get a kick out of it.”

Barclays, which has the naming rights of the Liberty and Brooklyn Nets’ home arena, signed a jersey patch sponsorship with the Liberty last season. The Barclays logo resides above the Nike swoosh that appears on all WNBA uniforms.

A sponsorship with the defending champions (especially champions who play in the largest media market in the U.S.) could have a notable price tag. To note, the Phoenix Mercury signed a multiyear sponsorship deal last season with venture capital firm Cleveland Avenue that was reportedly worth a league-leading $3 million per season.

Although insurance companies pulled back some spending in recent years due to rising claims and inflation, 2024 saw an uptick in ad spend from the four largest property and casualty insurers: Progressive, Allstate, State Farm (February’s Super Bowl withstanding) and Geico.

Liberty Mutual has a ubiquitous presence on television, and Jenna Lebel, Liberty Mutual’s CMO for its U.S. retail markets, believes the high engagement of women’s sports fans will be incredibly beneficial for both sides. She cited a February study of women’s sports TV from research firm EDO that claims ads airing during women’s sports events generate 40% more engagement than the typical primetime spot.

“Sponsorships provide advantages that aren’t always achievable through on-air media spending,” Lebel said in an email, “allowing us to engage directly with fans and strengthen our involvement within the community.”

Sponsors have been more than happy with their partnerships with the Liberty, with several pre-negotiating parade floats for the team’s championship parade prior to the start of the 2024 season. New York had come off a tough WNBA Finals loss to the Las Vegas Aces the prior season but was expected to be among the title favorites in 2024. With the team fulfilling its on-court promise, the sponsored floats rode down Manhattan’s Canyon of Heroes this past October.

The Liberty are making even bigger moves on the business end as the latest WNBA team to commit to building a practice facility—at a cost of $80 million, and fully funded by ownership—that will open in 2027.

At $130 million, New York ranks third in Sportico’s WNBA franchise valuations behind Las Vegas and Seattle. In 2023, the team generated $18 million in revenue, a total that is certain to have risen during its 2024 championship campaign.",57,18,2025-05-01,https://reddit.com/r/wnba/comments/1kc8b6p/liberty_liberty_new_yorks_wnba_franchise_signs/

GoNets,Egor really is letting it fly in Summer League,"Egor Demin in the four tournament Summer League games took 11 3's per 36 minutes with 85% of his shots being 3 points and the overwhelming majority of those of the catch-and-shoot variety. He shot well from 3 too (43%), which gives us an indication of the kind of role he's likely to play for the Nets, at least initially, and their vision of him. He's a connective wing who can make shots, make solid passing reads, and defend well against 2's and 3's. He'll get better defensively with strength and experience but he has shown good reactivity and mobility throughout the week, has put the effort in, and has the upside to be a plus on the defensive end as well.

Gaining strength is a necessity but we can't say aggression wasn't there when he's letting it fly this way. He's taking the shots available and making them. Passivity was a concern of his coming out but he's letting it fly from 3 which has been a great thing to watch. That shows confidence. Yes, the ability to score out of closeouts and effectively put the ball on the floor is going to be critical for him as we head into training camp and the start of the season, but this week has been a great first step in Egor's professional journey.

wnba,Jonquel Jones reacts to the hilarious distraction that shows the WNBA’s growth,"Through 17 New York Liberty home games, there’s been a different feeling in the air at Barclays Center. Really, it started during the 2023 WNBA Finals when 17,000 New Yorkers packed an arena that had grown accustomed to closing off the upper deck for WNBA games. 

The arena energy feels more like college sports, with coordinated cheers like the Ellie wave (for their mascot, Ellie the Elephant). Ellie has become a cult celebrity in New York, known for her distinctive outfits, jaw-dropping dance moves, side-splitting sideline antics, and the famed Elie Stomp — another fan favorite tradition.

Of those fans, many have been celebrities, shown during timeouts on CeLiberty Row. On Thursday, Flavor Flav took the microphone during a timeout to lead the crowd in a cheer of his own.

Liberty guard Kennedy Burke admitted the rapper’s surprise appearance distracted her as the team was in its huddle.

“I was taking peeks out at him, I was like, ‘oh, that's Flavor Flav,’ but we were already on the court like kind of huddling and talking about the next play,” Burke said. “But I took a quick glimpse.”

She wasn’t the only one. Jonquel Jones couldn’t focus in the huddle either. She noticed both Flavor Flav and Miami Heat legend Dwyane Wade, who caught the eye of the Barclays Center scoreboard operator in the next timeout.

“We were supposed to be in the huddle but I was watching him,” she admitted. “But just to see him, guys like D-Wade, a legend of the game, and just to know that we can draw those type of people in and that the game is just growing exponentially.”

Jason Sudeikis, a known Liberty fan, is a regular. So is Fran Leibowitz. Megan Thee Stallion, A Boogie, Michael Imperioli, Susan Sarandon, Jadakiss, Fat Joe, and Nigel Sylvester have all attended at least one game.

GoNets,Optimistic but frustrated AF,"1. KD was horrific by his standards but superstars like him usually have big response games. 

2. We were so damn sloppy 1st half. Way too many times the guy running the play was pounding the shit out of the rock before any play set up leading to easy predictable plays for Cs to get TOs 

3. Surely we cannot play a worse last 40 seconds of basketball the whole series. Right? The quick 2 for the Cs is absolutely inexcusable. Even forcing a bleed the clock 2 point shot works far better in nets favour. 

4. Kyrie is in his bag. Personally loved the shit he was pulling to the crowd. He cares so much and is desperate not to lose. Every player should have Kais mentality

That game was a near terrible showing and we lost on a buzzer beater. The nets are a better team overall but the lazy errors will make this series a nail biter.",54,43,2022-04-18,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/u62r6e/optimistic_but_frustrated_af/
GoNets,Thank you for the welcoming atmosphere - a depressed former Knicks Fan.,"Hey everyone. I just want to say thank you for accepting me and the other former Knicks fans. As a 24-year-old fan for well over a decade, this trade was just too much to handle. We all thought that the gross incompetence of the 2000's was a thing of the past, but clearly, Scott Perry and Steve Mills are perpetuating the ineptitude so synonymous with the Knicks. And I'm done. 

This nets team is beautiful, and I've been rooting for you guys since the rebuild. What this team has built is organic and inspiring. But I'm coming in relatively ignorant. Is there anything I should know as a new fan?

GoNets,"D’Angelo Russell Q&amp;A about Jordi Fernandez behind the scenes, how Fernandez is similar to former Nets coach Kenny Atkinson, his desire to re-sign with the Nets &amp; more","https://preview.redd.it/cm8yq414g4oe1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed35ab10778116f43c5714377fe1d09acc4c5cda

Following Brooklyn’s 111-108 win over the Los Angeles Lakers at Barclays Center, Nets guard **D’Angelo Russell** spoke with HoopsHype about coach **Jordi Fernandez** behind the scenes, how Fernandez is similar to former Nets coach **Kenny Atkinson**, his desire to re-sign with the Nets in free agency, his experience with the Lakers, **Austin Reaves**, and more.



**Scotto: How would you describe your relationship with Jordi Fernandez behind the scenes?**

**D’Angelo Russell:** I just appreciate it more than anything because I’ve come from places where I don’t have that relationship. I’ve kind of just had success off of just showing up and no relationship. With **JJ (Redick)**, I had a solid relationship with him on the way out. I told Jordi today for him to trust me and allow me to be a basketball player and not just a shot maker. If my shots aren’t falling, he still trusts me to be out there to make plays. I respect that more than anything. I’ve been kind of categorized as a guy who only makes shots, but being a basketball player is my strength. For him to trust me so soon since I’ve been here, I’m nothing but appreciative.



**Scotto: How would you compare and contrast Jordi Fernandez to Kenny Atkinson?**

  
**Russell:** They’re both workers. I think that’s where their success comes from. I’ve always been a fan of anything that starts from the top and trickles down. It’s easier to send that message. We see him every day coming in here and working. We see countless amount of hours watching film and things like that. I think that’s where it starts. Kenny had that same hunger, so I’m not surprised he’s doing what he’s doing over there (with the Cleveland Cavaliers).



**Scotto: What have you tried to do on the court as a leader with a younger roster around you since you arrived in Brooklyn following the trade?**

  
**Russell:** I try to reiterate Jordi’s messages as much as I can. He speaks what he means. As a young group, it can go through one ear and out the other, so I try to be another voice on the team that can relay his message and lead by example.



**Scotto: What’s been different here for you in Brooklyn, where you’ve had success compared to other places?**

  
**Russell:** Team. I’ve been on so many different teams where the team’s not a priority. To be here, the team is everything from every aspect you can think of. It’s team-oriented. As a team, we win. As a team, we lose. To be engraved into that and just fit in is a good feeling.



**Scotto: What did it mean to you to return to Brooklyn?**

  
**Russell:** It’s great. I would never take it for granted, coming from where I came from. Obviously, I was a little traumatized there. To be here and get the opportunity to just be me where there’s familiarity as well is just icing on the cake. I’m at the point in my career where I’m not going out and scoring 25 points every night and wowing with numbers. It’s a point where I’m trying to gravitate towards doing it the right way, and how I can contribute to winning is my priority. He (Coach Fernandez) lets me do that. He trusts me already, so I can imagine getting to training camp for something like that and having that under my belt with the guys. I think the sky’s the limit.





**Scotto: Would you be open to returning next season as a Net?**

  
**Russell:** Yeah. Why wouldn’t I? I keep seeing stuff coming out. I’ll tell you. Heck yeah. I want to be wherever I’m at. I’m here. I love these guys. I appreciate this, and I would love to be back.



**Scotto: You’re also close with Austin Reaves, who you played against tonight. What have you seen from him since you departed in the trade for Dorian-Finney-Smith?**

  
**Russell:** His role has changed a little bit. He’s such a killer, and he’s so underrated. I don’t think that **LeBron (James)** or **Luka (Doncic)** can hinder his success or knock him off of how good he is. Kudos to him. I’m cheering for him.

GoNets,Allen Crabbe's defense,"Over the past few days I had been having mixed feelings towards the Allan Crabbe trade.  I liked that Marks is being aggressive and continues to add talent to the Nets.  However, after reading multiple articles about Crabbe, most notably his Season Review Blazer's Edge  https://www.blazersedge.com/2017/5/19/15666308/allen-crabbe-season-review-portland-trail-blazers-2016-2017 , I began to seriously question if this was a bad trade.

From BlazerEdge:  *""Defensive advanced stats suggested that Crabbe is glaringly bad. Among Blazers players, he had the worst defensive rating on the team, third worst defensive box plus/minus (behind CJ McCollum and Damian Lillard), and worst defensive real plus/minus.""*

Is this true?  I thought last off season when the Nets made a run at him he was a good defender.   Instead of a 3 and D, is Crabbe a 3 and terrible D?  

I haven't watched enough Blazers games to make a real judgement.  I assume most Nets fan haven't.  Sadly there aren't many lengthy clips of Crabbe's defense from last season online to make a personal opinion on the matter either.  So I looked into it.  

The first thing I note is that the reference of his defensive rating  (basketball-reference.com) is not consistent with other web-sites.  Basketball-Reference.com had him at a defensive rating of 114.  But then checking on NBA.com  I see a defensive rating of 108.9, which is very middle of the pack (For perspective, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is a 107.7 defensive rating on NBA.com).  FoxSports had yet another number.  So how can we take this metric seriously when it is being calculated differently from every source. 

Secondly, what is defensive rating?  I googled it and came up with this:

The formula is: *Defensive Rating = (Opponent's Points Allowed/ Opponent's Possessions) x 100. The result is the expected amount of points that an individual player will allow on defense over 100 possessions. This stat can be significantly influenced by the defense of a player's teammates.*

This seemed incredibly biased based on a team's defense and style.  I would think that a team's defense has more to do with a player's defensive rating then the actual player. In fact, if you look at  the Blazer's defensive rating per player you can see a lot of players correlate http://stats.nba.com/players/defense/#!?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612757

Damian Lillard (108.9), McCollum (107.9), and Harkless (108.3) who along with Crabbe (108.9) were the four players that the most minutes for the Blazers last season.  And they all had similar defensive ratings.  Again, this leads me to believe defensive rating has a lot more to do with team play than individual defense.

Further, I looked at Joe Johnson on basketball-reference.com and he had a defensive rating of 112.0 on the Nets in 2016 while a 108.1 in Utah this past season.  It is unlikely that Johnson after 16 season magically got better at defense.  It is simply that Johnson went from a bad defensive team to a good defensive team.

Also, on a quick google search of Crabbe, RipCityProject.com had a completely year end review of Crabbe's defense.  https://ripcityproject.com/2017/05/20/allen-crabbe-prove-worth/  claiming Crabbe played good defense, provided clips of this (and he looked good in these brief highlights), and noted that Crabbe would regularly guard the opposing team's best perimeter player.  Similarly I have seen other articles reference Crabbe as a good defender.  https://hardwoodhoudini.com/2017/07/27/silent-deadly-boston-celtics/ - also, just looking at certain Blazer's forum several fans do think he is a solid defender. 

Anyway, it made me feel a lot better with the situation and Crabbe may not be a terrible defender that has been made out.  Figured I'd share.

GoNets,With the playoff race getting closer and closer it makes me reminisce..,"About how we threw away the pelicans game. Or how we choked that 20 pt lead to the Thunder. Or when we let the Cavs beat us. Or when we let the grizzlies come back up 7 with 45 seconds remaining. Or when we lead philly the whole game and we let Jimmy sink the game winner on us. And when Lou Will hit that ridiculous shot. Man we would be a lock for a playoff spot if it wasnt for these games we threw away(besides clippers game)

Then Again...

I also remember the surprising victory over the Raptors sparking a 7 game win streak. And the Rockets game where Dinwiddie unleashed his Inner T-Mac. Or the time when D’lo dropped the dagger on LA. Don’t forget when Levert dropped  game winners on the Nuggets and the Knicks. Sure as hell remember clamping the Pistons in a dominating fashion and getting a standing O from the crowd at the end of the first half and finally when D’lo absolutely demolished the Kings for the heroic victory.  

Man this season has been up and down but for what its has made us all more excited then ever about Nets Basketball and the future of our team. No matter how this season ends just remember that nobody expected anything from us this year, and now we are raising eyebrows around the league and more importantly amongst the most marquee free agents.

wnba,Emotions ran deep for Valkyries GM seeing ex-club Liberty win WNBA title: Weight ‘lifted off me’,"Ohemaa Nyanin walked into the Barclays Center for Game 2 of the WNBA Finals last month as she had done countless times before.

The emotions this time, though, were different.

For the five seasons prior to 2024, Nyanin had given her all to the Liberty.

She was general manager Jonathan Kolb’s first hire and started as a manager of basketball operations before working her way up to assistant GM.

She had watched the Liberty go from averaging fewer than 2,300 fans per game in 2019 at Westchester County Center to selling out Barclays Center.

This moment and “unreal” experience was what she had been working for.

Only now, Nyanin, hired in May to be the Golden State Valkyries’ first GM, was just another scout in the stands.

But a piece of her heart remained in Brooklyn for all of last season. That’s why it was important for her to attend one of the Liberty’s Finals games — a win to tie the series at 1-1 made the trip back home even sweeter.

But for the final three games of the best-of-five series, Nyanin retreated to her San Francisco condo. She watched Game 3 and 4 alone. When the Minnesota Lynx forced a winner-takes-all Game 5, Valkyries vice president of basketball operations Vanja Cernivec invited herself over to Nyanin’s place.

Still, Nyanin couldn’t hide her happiness for the Liberty, despite having traded in her seafoam threads for Valkyries violet. She cheered and clapped with her purple hue manicure glistening in the light.

“I kept telling Vanja, ‘I’m so sorry you’re seeing me in my element,’ ” Nyanin recalled. After Leonie Fiebich picked off a Lynx pass with the Liberty up by five with 10 seconds left in overtime, relief and joy started to settle in for Nyanin.

By the time the final horn rang, a bottle of champagne had been popped and two glasses poured.

“I vividly remember a physical weight being lifted off me,” Nyanin said. “It was the perfect way to cap my experience with the Liberty.”

Make no mistake about it, leaving the Liberty for a higher position at Golden State wasn’t easy for Nyanin.

“Making this decision, it was the hardest decision I’ve made ever,” she said. “Because I knew what we were going to be able to do \[win a championship\], and I also wanted this opportunity.”

At times throughout the interview process, she doubted that she would even be seriously considered. When she finally got the offer, she questioned whether she could leave the players and staff whom she had built such tight, trusted relationships with. She distinctly remembers the day she walked into Kolb’s office this spring and told him the news. She closed the door, signaling to her then-boss that the conversation they were about to have was regarding a serious matter.

“I got the job,” she said, bracing for any potential negative reaction.

But Nyanin’s admission was met by an enthusiastic Kolb.

“I knew it! I knew it!” Kolb said. “Are you excited?”

Joyful tears formed in Nyanin’s eyes. Of course the opportunity to be a WNBA GM exhilarated her, but there was still a sliver of doubt whether leaving at that time, for this specific job, was the right move. Kolb offered his full support.

“Of course I’m excited,” he told her. “This is what you wanted. You worked hard for this.”

The two franchises worked together to help make the transition more seamless. Nyanin tied up a few loose ends with the Liberty so she could hit the ground running with the Valkyries May 13.

“I had to quickly switch my mind to, ‘But I can still set \[the Liberty\] up for success.’ And success only meant a championship,” Nyanin said. “And I felt like I did that.”

Months have passed since Nyanin packed up her Brooklyn condo and headed for the West Coast.

From afar, she watched the Liberty earn the top seed of the playoffs while she created a blueprint for Golden State’s success and helped prepare the franchise for its inaugural season in 2025.

“\[The Liberty\] winning was all the validation that I needed,” Nyanin said. “I didn’t need to be at the parade, I didn’t need to be kind of at any of those very public celebrations. I just needed to make sure that they got what they worked so hard for.

“\[The\] 2024 season was a tough season for me partly because I was starting a new season but I was very emotionally connected to the Liberty until Oct. 20. When that final buzzer went, I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’m now only Valkyrie Violet.’ ”

Nyanin met with Kolb after the Liberty won the franchise’s first title.

They hugged and talked through the journey it took to get there. Nyanin was there for most of it, but now she’s embarking on that process again with a new team — only this time she’ll bear the brunt of the responsibilities.

But after working with Kolb, she knows she’s ready.

“He’s a great person and a peer mentor,” Nyanin said, “and just to kind of see your people win is always a source of pride for me.”

GoNets,The Story of the Brooklyn Nets Rebuild 2014-2018,"On July 13, 2014 Paul Pierce left the Nets to sign with the Washington Wizards, effectively ending Brooklyn’s short tenure as an NBA playoff team / overpriced fringe contender.

During the 2014 summer Brooklyn didn’t really do much. The team didn’t have any draft picks but they bought three second round picks and took Cory Jefferson, Markel Brown and Xavier Thames. also made a three team trade with Boston and Cleveland which sent out Marcus Thornton and two euro stash players who have never come over. They brought back Jarrett Jack and Sergey Karasev. I guess that trade was a win? Jack was a steady but unspectacular point guard for them for two years. Karasev is out of the league now. 

The Nets also brought over Bojan Bogdanovic and signed Alan Anderson during the summer of 2014. Anderson played two years in brooklyn, appearing in 152 games, starting 45. He was pretty bad, his PER hovered around 10. Bojan provided solid but unspectacular volume scoring for two and a half years before being traded to the Wizards at the 2017 deadline (for a lottery protected first (became Jarrett Allen), andrew nicholson and the return of marcus thornton).

At the 2015 trade deadline the nets sent Kevin Garnett back home to Minnesota in exchange for Thaddeus Young. This was awesome. Good trade for both sides, Young went on to opt out that summer and re-sign with the Nets for four years, 54 million. Not a great contract for a rebuilding team although Young played a lot, tried hard and kept them semi-respectable during the 2015-16 season before being dealt to Indiana the following summer for a first round pick (became Caris LeVert). 

On draft night 2015, the Nets traded Mason Plumlee and Pat Connaughton to Portland for Steve Blake and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. This was a good move, Hollis-Jefferson has shown more promise than Connaughton and Mason Plumlee later received a huge contract from the Denver Nuggets. 

The Nets took Chris McCullough with the 29th pick in the first round. McCullough was sent to the Wizards in the Bojan Bogdanovic trade at the 2015 deadline. The wizards declined his fourth year team option, it seems unlikely that McCullough has an NBA future. 

Rondae Hollis-Jefferson is currently the longest tenured Brooklyn Net, despite being only 23 years old. Hollis-Jefferson has played heavy minutes for the team the past three years, alternating between starter and bench roles. He’s a hybrid 3/4 , at least ideally, but his ceiling is inherently limited by the fact that he can’t shoot at all. RHJ has one year left on his rookie deal, it will interesting to see what his market is like next summer. 

Nets legend Brook Lopez opted out and became a free agent during the summer of 2015. The leading scorer in franchise history re-signed with the Nets for three years, 60 million. Lopez was later traded to the Lakers in 2017.  

On July 11, 2015 they waived former superstar Deron Williams. They bought out Williams’ final two years for approximately 25 million even though he was still owed two years, 43.5. This seems like a good move although it also speaks to how unattractive playing for the Brooklyn Nets was at the time. A guy gave up almost twenty million just to get out of there. The Nets used the stretch provision on Williams, meaning that he will count as $5.5 million of dead cap money every year until 2019-2020. 

The Nets’ final move in the summer of 2015 was to sign former number one pick Andrea Bargnani to a minimum deal that was two years with a partial guarantee for the second year. They bought him out of this deal in February 2016, 2 days after the hiring of Sean Marks. Bargnani has not played in the NBA since. 

On January 10, 2016, Billy King was fired from his job as general manager but for some reason continued to consult Nets ownership as they searched for his replacement. At least that’s what Woj reported when they fired him. 

Whatever search process the team used must have worked fine because the Nets hired retired NBA player and Spurs assistant GM Sean Marks on February 18, 2016. The Nets almost immediately waived Bargnani and then made moves to buy out Joe Johnson. Joe Johnson only gave up about three million so clearly he didn’t want to get out of there even close to as badly as former backcourt mate Deron Williams. 

Marks then used the roster spot vacated by Johnson to sign Sean Kilpatrick, who played on two 10 day contracts before signing a multiple year deal on March 19, 2016. Kilpatrick was in the Nets rotation during the 16-17 season but was ultimately waived in December 2017. 

The Nets only selection in the 2016 draft was Marcus Paige, who they took with the 25th pick of the 2nd round. They traded Paige and cash to the Jazz for Isaiah Whitehead. Somewhat similar to Kilpatrick, Whitehead was a fringe NBA guard who averaged 22 minutes per game for the nets during the 2016-17 season. Whitehead is still on the Nets although he played considerably less this past year, making frequent trips to the G League’s Long Island Nets. 

On June 30, 2016, failing to find a good trade partner, the Nets declined Jarrett Jack’s player option. Jack tweeted a laughing emoji that afternoon.   

Markel Brown, Wayne Ellington, Sergey Karasev, Shane Larkin, Willie Reed, Thomas Robinson, Henry Sims and Donald Sloan all became free agents after the 2015-16 season and none of them returned to the Nets. 

The Nets were active during the summer of 2016, signing Jeremy Lin to a multiple year deal, and Allen Crabbe and Tyler Johnson to poison pill offer sheets that were matched by Portland and Miami respectively. All of these contracts were overpays, in no doubt influenced by Brooklyn’s hopeless franchise position and in the cases of Crabbe and Johnson their attempts to lure restricted free agents with their ample cap space. The Nets knew they were going to have to pay a ‘Nets tax’, and they were mostly fine with it. 

Jeremy Lin’s deal was 3 years, 36 million. Lin has only played 37 games in two years since signing that contract, hopefully he’ll be healthy this upcoming season. 

In July of 2016 the Nets traded Thaddeus Young to the Pacers for Caris Levert. Levert has appeared in 128 games for the Nets these past two seasons and has shown potential as a scoring wing. 

They also added Justin Hamilton, Greivis Vasquez, Luis Scola, Anthony Bennett, Randy Foye, Joe Harris and Yogi Ferrell during the 2016 offseason and exercised team options on Chris McCullough and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. 

At the 2017 trade deadline the Nets made their Bojan Bogdanovic trade mentioned above. This deal sent Bogdanovic and McCullough to the Wizards for Nicholson, Thornton and a lottery protected first. 

During the 2017 Draft the Nets selected Jarrett Allen with the 22nd pick that they received from Indiana in the Bogdanovic trade. Allen probably has the most trade value of anyone on the Nets, having displayed ability as a raw rim runner and shot blocker during his rookie season. 

On draft night the Nets dealt Brook Lopez and the draft rights to Kyle Kuzma (27th pick, from Boston as part of Pierce, KG trade) to the Lakers in exchange for Timofey Mozgov and D’Angelo Russell. Mozgov has a gargantuan contract (4 years, 64 million signed during the summer of 2016) and the Nets expect him to be nothing more than a serviceable bench big. They willingly took on Mozgov’s contract in exchange for rolling the dice with D-Lo, the #2 pick in the 2015 draft. Russell was disappointing during his first year with the Nets but is still very young (entering age 22 season) and has high potential as a scoring combo guard. 

The Nets continued to stay busy during the summer of 2017, suggesting a strategic shift towards accepting overpaid, ‘bad’ contracts of guys who were at least able to be solid contributors and rotation players. Entering their final year without a first round pick from the infamous Boston trade, the Nets had no reason to try to be as bad as possible and had plenty of cap space, having been completely unattractive to free agents for years. 

They signed Otto Porter to a max offer sheet which the Wizards matched. 

On July 13, 2017 the Nets traded Justin Hamilton to the Raptors for DeMarre Carroll and his contract (2 years, 30 million remaining at the time) along with Toronto’s 2018 first and a conditional second. 

Carroll started 73 games for the Nets last year and provided at least a decent facsimile of good three and D play. He’s obviously not worth his contract but may have slight trade value this year now that he’s on an expiring deal and could potentially help a good team. 

A year after matching their offer sheet, the Trail Blazers dealt Allen Crabbe to the Nets for Andrew Nicholson, basically a pure salary dump for Portland. This trade has worked out reasonably well for the Nets because Crabbe was solid this year and again may have some value to a good team because of his ability to hit catch and shoot threes. 

On December 7, 2017 the Nets traded Trevor Booker to the Sixers for disappointing lottery picks Jahlil Okafor, Nik Stauskas and the Knicks’ 2019 second. This is the right kind of trade for a talent deprived team to make, buying low on guys who were once highly valued. But neither Okafor nor Stauskas was able to contribute much this past year. Stauskas was better, he at least shot 40% on 7.5 threes per 36 minutes. Okafor was one of the worst rotation bigs in the league and the Nets hemorrhaged points with him on the floor. 

At the 2018 trade deadline the Nets only moves were to send Tyler Zeller to Milwaukee in exchange for a second round pick (the 45th pick in this year’s draft) and Rashad Vaughn, who they then traded to New Orleans for Dante Cunningham. This is a good, minor move which ended up yielding a decently useful second.

As it stands the Nets most valuable future assets are Jarrett Allen and their 2019 first round pick. D’angelo Russell, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Caris Levert all have solid potential but it’s easy to imagine them being moved if the right deal came along. 

I would like to see the team explore Spencer Dinwiddie trades, given his unexpected success last season and the team’s glut of guards. Dinwiddie could be a nice bench piece on a good team but has no long term future in Brooklyn. Jeremy Lin could also fetch something at next year’s trade deadline if he is able to get healthy and rehab his value at the start of this year. 

Demarre Carroll and Allen Crabbe are overpaid but they aren’t completely dead salary. These guys could be sent to a good team in exchange for some worse contracts and a future asset. Think Gorgui Dieng or Ian Mahinmi and a lightly protected future first. 

It would be nice to see the Nets re-sign Joe Harris this summer if his price tag is reasonable. However, it’s easy to imagine a contender falling in love with Harris, given his three point stroke and expected affordability. 

Overall one has to feel that the Nets have done close to the best they possibly could have given the circumstances that the Boston trade left them in. Very excited to see what Sean Marks can with a full asset base moving forward.

GoNets,Regarding fans at the Barclays…,"Like others, I was definitely bummed out listening to that podcast Mikal was on.

I know it’s been sounding and feeling bad being at the games hearing fans from other teams drown us out. But even before KD and Kyrie there was a really good atmosphere that proves a good product and a hard working team gives Nets fans the right energy and reasons to show up.

Been a fan since ‘01 as a kid in Jersey, but eventually moved to NYC as many do around here. I first joined the BK Block in 2018-2019, and the first 20 or so games were miserable. We were basically on a 10 game losing streak at one point and we had to shout over fans from every other team every night. Somehow even Jazz fans outnumbered us one night which was insane. But then the magic of that year started brewing after that players-only meeting. All of a sudden D’Lo and Caris started playing at an all-star level. Jarret Allen was becoming a force. Rondae and Theo started busting moves on the bench. Game by game you saw more and more Nets fans come back. The whole team was fun to watch and always hustled and grinded, even though many nights we were outmatched on talent.

I vividly remember a game against the  Blake Griffin-led Pistons, and if we won it we clinched a playoff seed. I’ve never heard the place so loud that entire season. The whole arena was on their feet for the last possession of the first half because we were absolutely killing them. 

All the way until the playoffs, we had that same energy in the arena. It was amazing. Even that home game 3 vs Philly in the first round was insane. 

The Knicks have definitely gone through periods where it was just as  miserable to go to games as a fan, although a lot less painful than us in BK considering how many fans they have/how long the team has been there. Their fans can deny that all they want, but my dad is a Knick fan and we would go to games when they sucked, and there were several times fans of other teams drowned out the  Knick fans. Now, they (NYK) have a lot of parallels to the 18-19 Nets, just a better version. 

Sadly, I can’t go to as many games since I’ve moved a bit further away :( But we’ll get back there soon. Just need guys who will go out there and give it their all, and a coach that continually inspires and demands that out of them. 

Oh, and winning a bit helps too.",51,50,2024-02-16,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1ascxgd/regarding_fans_at_the_barclays/
GoNets,Nets Mascot Ideas,"I’m a season ticket holder and feel like, as great as Mr Whammy is, we could use a real mascot again. We had Ellie from our Liberty sisters for a game recently and damn if she didn’t bring the whole house down. 

Some ideas:
- Rat. Maybe it’s our Ratscot? Maybe it loves pizza for the ratings? 
- Pigeon. They’re afraid of nothing, lots of opportunity. 
- Bodega cat. Maybe it’s low energy but surprises us with its shenanigans.

GoNets,"“We don’t use some of those words [like ‘tanking’], so it’s go compete, go compete and let the chips fall where they may.” - Sean Marks","https://preview.redd.it/k4k0waisja1e1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c1c090dd26edefde86658d1fd13f5fbe33f3877

**NEW YORK** \-- Don’t tell the[ Brooklyn Nets](https://www.nj.com/nets/) they’re supposed to be tanking for Duke’s [Cooper Flagg](https://www.nj.com/sports/2024/02/cooper-flagg-wasnt-born-a-basketball-star-in-fact-the-nations-top-prospect-was-lucky-to-have-been-born-at-all.html) or [Rutgers ](https://www.nj.com/rutgersbasketball/)stars [Ace Bailey](https://www.nj.com/rutgersbasketball/2024/10/nba-scouts-react-to-ace-baileys-rutgers-debut-he-will-challenge-cooper-for-no-1.html) and[ Dylan Harper.](https://www.nj.com/rutgersbasketball/2024/11/dylan-harper-relishes-dominant-rutgers-debut-dream-come-true.html)

“We don’t use some of those words \[like ‘tanking’\], so it’s go compete, go compete and let the chips fall where they may,” Nets GM Sean Marks told [NJ.com](http://nj.com/) in an exclusive interview before the Nets lost to the [Knicks](https://www.nj.com/knicks/), 124-122, in an NBA Cup game Friday night at Madison Square Garden. The Nets trailed by 21 points in the third quarter but took the lead in the final seconds before Jalen Brunson hit a game-winning 3-pointer.

When Brooklyn dealt [Mikal Bridges](https://www.nj.com/sports/2024/06/knicks-go-all-in-on-nba-title-run-by-trading-for-4th-villanova-star-in-mikal-bridges-i-bring-winning-to-your-team.html) to the rival Knicks in a blockbuster summer trade that brought back four first-round picks, including one in next summer’s star-driven NBA Draft, it was widely understood that [the Nets were trying to “Wave the White Flagg for Cooper Flagg](https://www.nj.com/nets/2024/10/cooper-flagg-could-trigger-brooklyn-nets-rebuild-through-draft-thats-how-you-end-up-with-tatum-and-brown.html).”

Entering the 2024-25 NBA season, the Nets were No. 1 on [Tankathon.com](https://tankathon.com/) in terms of odds to land the No. 1 pick, which could be Flagg, the uber-talented 6-foot-9 Duke freshman, but also could be the 6-10 Bailey, who scored 17 points, including a highlight-reel dunk, in his Rutgers debut Friday night.

The over/under on the Nets win total was 19.5, per Vegas oddsmakers.

But under first-year coach Jordi Fernandez, the Nets (5-8) are competing hard and and would be in the mix for the Play-In Tournament if the postseason started today. Which, of course, it does not.

Even when they lose, they are competitive. They led the reigning NBA champion Boston Celtics by 13 points on Wednesday before losing, 139-114.

Against the Knicks, Cam Thomas poured in 43 points and Dennis Schröder hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 11.5 seconds left before Brunson’s game-winner.

“Credit my guys, we talked about continuing to believe and fight and fight together,” Fernandez said. “Even though we were down 18 in the fourth, we kept fighting and we found a way. And we didn’t stop fighting.”

He added: “Losing hurts, and it hurts to all of us. Right there we showed our identity, and nobody can take that away from us. Nobody.”

After the loss, the Nets were projected to draft at No. 8, with [Tankathon](https://tankathon.com/mock_draft) projecting they will 7-foot-2 Duke freshman big man [Khaman Maluach](https://www.nj.com/sports/2024/07/a-17-year-old-duke-freshman-is-living-his-dream-at-the-paris-olympics-and-hes-being-coached-by-a-nj-legend.html) \-- not Flagg or Bailey.

“I think you navigate the season as it goes, and you don’t go into a season saying this is where we’re going to be, this is how it’s going to end,” Marks said outside the visiting locker room at the Garden. “There’s a lot of unforeseen things.”

He added: “You’ve gotta give credit to these players, they’re playing with a chip on their shoulder, the coaches are doing a helluva job, so that’s exciting to see. It’s exciting to see an identity being formed and a culture being driven. So who am I to push back on that?”

Marks, of course, is doing his due diligence ahead of what’s expected to be a potentially historic draft next summer.

After the Bridges trade, the Nets now have 15 first-round picks over the next seven years, including four in 2025.

“This year specifically, with all the picks that we have, we have to be scouting a very wide range,” Marks said. “And that’s fine, that’s exciting, we’ve never had that opportunity before.”

The highest pick the Nets have had since Marks became GM in 2016 was No. 17 in 2019, which they used on Nickeil Alexander-Walker, who was promptly traded and ended up in New Orleans.

The Nets haven’t had a lottery pick since choosing Derrick Favors at No. 3 in 2010. Favors has been out of the NBA for three years.

Ahead of next year’s draft, Marks has attended multiple Rutgers’ games, including the preseason exhibition with Rick Pitino’s St. John’s club where both Marks and Nets assistant GM B.J. Johnson were in attendance on a night when Bailey and Harper combined for 45 points.

After that game, one NBA scout said of Bailey: “He’s \[among the\] top-3 youth players in the world. Everyone has Cooper Fever, \[but\] he will challenge Cooper for No. 1.

“It’s not clear cut.”

There’s still a long way to go in this NBA season -- and an even longer time before the draft.

A lot can happen.

The Nets could go into a tailspin and emerge with one of the top picks in the draft. Adam Silver could end up announcing Flagg or Bailey or Harper to the Nets on draft night.

But for now, the Nets are competing and could end up in the mix for a playoff spot, in which case they’d miss out on potential franchise-changing players like Flagg or Bailey.

  
“Well, these guys \[on the Nets\] have done something really right if that’s the case,” Marks said, “and I love that.”

GoNets,"[Analysis] Despite the loss to OKC, some of the Nets had good moments. That and looking at stats during the Nets losing streak","Even with the losing streak continuing at the hands of the OKC Thunder, multiple Nets players had good (and bad) moments during the game that can provide some happiness for fans, I think.

**First off, Rodions**

In yesterday's game, Rodions played pretty well on both ends in limited minutes. In my opinion, he should been playing in the overtime over Temple, but I digress. Any who, while everyone (including myself) makes note of Rodi's early struggles and refusal to shoot open threes, something he has shown improvement on during his play this year is his passing. 

[First, Rodi drives baseline and throws a nice one handed pass on the move to JA who dunks (or aggressively lays it up) all over Muscala](https://streamable.com/qwfet). 

[Kurucs gets the pass from Dinwiddie, drives toward the middle and passes it off to JA for the dunk to avoid the charge](https://streamable.com/6squr). Might be me, but I think if this was last year's Rodi, this would of probably been a charge and OKC's ball.

[Rodi hits JA with another one handed pass on his drive attempt, JA passes it back, Rodi recognizes that he has CP3 and Bazley (Prince's man) in front of him, and passes it back out to Prince for an open three.](https://streamable.com/zxfjq) Good recognition on Rodi's part.

Even when Rodi providing much offensively, he can provide respectable defense. He had pretty good moments guarding OKC's three guards. 

[Here we see Rodi doing a good job getting over the Adams screen by avoiding contact, gets back in the play, and Dennis forces a difficult shot for a miss](https://streamable.com/wmvvf)

[Even though this isn't the CP3 of old, he's still crafty and a great ball wizard who can fool anyone. Rodi doesn't fall for the CP3 wizardry, gets over the Adams screen again, and the possession ends in a Adams travel.](https://streamable.com/9chjz)

[Rodi follows SGA around, who can't get decent separation on the step back, and ends up settling for a long three that misses] (https://streamable.com/zf1lj).

After the abysmal start to the season, Rodi seems to be finding his footing slowly. Hopefully it continues, since he's been one of the few bright spots during this losing streak.

**Jarrett Allen**

While Jarrett Allen's offensive production has diminished along with the rest of the offense for the last month, he's still one of the best rim protectors in the league. And this season, we're starting to see Allen defend guards on the perimeter with more success.

[CP3 iso's JA at the top of the three point line, but JA stays with him and he's forced to pass to SGA. Rodi ends the possession playing good defense and forcing SGA into a touch shot](https://streamable.com/vykfw)

[Again, JA is switched onto CP3, but CP3 can't get by him and is forced to pass](https://streamable.com/7396g)

[SGA gets JA on a switch, but misses the rim completely on the layup attempt due to JA's defense and length](https://streamable.com/cuu5d)

Even outside of switches, JA is still a deterrent at the rim. 

[In transition, CP3 pushes the ball, but gets nothing. He tries to pass the ball to SGA for what would of been an open three because Prince is too far away, but gets denied because JA blocks the pass. Then JA makes his way into the paint to for a huge block on Ferguson](https://streamable.com/dbujy).

[Another example of JA's length bother opposing players. SGA has an open layup, but Allen comes off Adams to protect the rim and SGA misses the tough layup over JA's outstretched arm](https://streamable.com/h023o). 

Outside of JA's defensive prowess, he made multiple nice passes in yesterday's game.

[After setting the screen for Dinwiddie, JA gets the ball on the rim dive, spins, and hits Prince for a open three that goes in](https://streamable.com/hvapj)

[After slipping the screen, JA gets the ball from Dinwiddie. He feels / notices Bazley to his left and throws the ball to Prince for a wide open three](https://streamable.com/j07kr)

[After a horrible Dinwiddie miss, Allen is able to hit Prince in the corner for three that misses after being surrounded by three players](https://streamable.com/j52kz).


**Taurean Prince**

While Prince finally had a good shooting performance, there's still a lot left to desire on the defensive end.

[On this play, Prince helps off of Bazley in the corner too much to protect the rim when JA is right there to cover for Kurucs, giving Bazley an open three that he makes](https://streamable.com/pi15u)

[Prince closes out to Bazley, but he has his hands at his sides the entire time and gives up the drive to the right and has to foul](https://streamable.com/1q81k)

[Off a miss, Prince is caught ball watching and helping way too much off of Ferguson, giving him an open three that he makes](https://streamable.com/sbhm0)

[Again, Prince gets caught ball watching on the CP3 drive, leaving Dennis open for a three](https://streamable.com/4c2et)

**Miscellaneous** 

LeVert had [two](https://streamable.com/gzjgj) [nice](https://streamable.com/xuwvb) passes to DJ during the game. Glad to see him back on the court. 

[I have no idea why GT threw this lob pass to DJ when he had a wide open layup, but it worked out](https://streamable.com/eg9mn)

[DJ missing a wide open TLC for three was pretty bad and funny when watching live. TLC looked so defeated.](https://streamable.com/4qxrg)

[This is not a shot the Nets need GT taking right now](https://streamable.com/20i7p)

**Some stats**

***First, good stats:*** 

For the season, the Nets are 14th in DEFRTG. In December, the Nets ranked 3rd in DEFRTG at 104.2, behind only the Bucks and Bulls(???).  In the last 15 games, they are second behind the bucks. Since Christmas, they're ranked 7th in DEFRTG. 

Opponents have averaged 45 points in the paint (PITP) vs. the Nets this season, good for 8th. From Dec. 1st until January 9th, opponents have averaged 42 PITP, good for second behind the bucks. Opponents shot 58% in the restricted area vs. the Nets, good for third, behind the bucks and raptors. Since Christmas, they're basically tied with the Jazz for second at 56%. 

***Next, the bad:*** 

For the season, the Nets are shooting 59% in the restricted area (RA), tied for 4th worst with the Raptors. The Nets shoot the most shots in the paint of any team this season. Since Christmas, they're shooting 53%, tied with the Bulls for worst in the league.

The Nets are also shooting 33% from three, tied for third worst in the league. They average the 6th most attempts in the league. During the losing streak, they are shooting a league worse 29.7% from three on 40.9 attempts per game. The 40.9 attempts is tied for third highest attempts. 

The Nets OFFRTG on the season is ranked 24 at 105.3, but during the losing streak it is dead last at 95.5(!!!!) 

Digging into some player numbers, you get [this shitty chart that I made in excel.](https://i.imgur.com/LedvHGf.png)

Some notables:

* Dinwiddie is shooting SEVEN PERCENT (THIS IS NOT A TYPO) ON PULL UP THREES DURING THE LOSING STREAK. All of them are shooting horribly on pulls up during this streak, but god damn.
* The league average FG% in the RA is around 57%. Prince's FG% in the RA dropping from 57 in 2018-19 to 40 19-20 is very note worthy. Temple's drop in FG% in the RA is also note worthy. 
* Caris's drop in FG% in the RA feels accurate just watching, he forces a lot of shots at times and [he gets poor results.](https://streamable.com/x7coo) 

All of this to say, the Nets defense has been surprisingly pretty good given the personnel, but the offensive has been a dumpster fire. People are screaming at Kenny to make adjustments, but I don't think you can make an adjustment for people missing their threes *this badly.* There's going to be variance in shooting performances in small samples sizes, but these number are horrendously bad. The Nets style of offense is currently failing them, but with LeVert back and hopefully Kyrie next week, maybe their luck starts to turn around.",48,4,2020-01-09,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/emiclr/analysis_despite_the_loss_to_okc_some_of_the_nets/

GoNets,"Piston Fan Jumping Ship, Joining the Nets For 2021","The ownership/Front Office in Detroit is broken, so I was searching for a new team to follow closely this year. I pretty quickly narrowed it down to Brooklyn or Atlanta and decided to follow Bruce Brown to Brooklyn.

I hope that you'll allow an out-of-towner to join your crew.

Bruce Brown, btw, is the most underrated player the NBA. In fact, he is a genuinely EXCELLENT player. Not good, but excellent. He's the Nets missing piece. I expect that before long, he'll be logging 30 minutes a night, even in a crowded situation.

Bruce Brown can break down a defense off the dribble and get to the basket at will (seriously!!). He's an excellent shovel passer in tight quarters near the rim. He's learned to shoot the corner 3. He's an intense defender, an agitator that enjoys annoying the opposition.

And how Detroit traded him for a pile of poo is indefensible. So, I got out of a ""bad marriage.""

Watching the Nets climb out of the abyss to where they are today has been stunning. I'm looking forward to watching them contend for the title.

wnba,New York Liberty Named to Fast Company’s Annual List of the World’s Most Innovative Companies of 2025," The reigning WNBA Champion New York Liberty have been named to Fast Company’s prestigious list of the World’s Most Innovative Companies of 2025, in recognition of the team’s work to shape industry and culture in advertising and marketing.

In a year of surging interest in women’s sports, the New York Liberty firmly established the franchise as an enduring leader in the WNBA, and across the sports and entertainment industry broadly. The NY Liberty’s marketing campaigns redefine what is possible for a professional sports team and increase its appeal in creative ways, resulting in monumental growth across nearly every area of the business.

“We are incredibly proud to be named to Fast Company’s 2025 Most Innovative Companies list, a recognition that reflects our relentless dedication, passion, and vision for what women’s sports can achieve,” said Keia Clarke, Chief Executive Officer, New York Liberty. “We remain committed to pushing the boundaries of excellence both on and off the court, as we continue toward our goal to redefine what it means to be a champion.”

Off-the-court, the 2024 WNBA season saw the Liberty elevate the status of their viral mascot, Ellie the Elephant, to reach new audiences and draw in new fans, and ultimately support business goals of increasing brand exposure, driving ticket sales and building generational fandom. The team molded Ellie into an iconic performer, cultural icon and influencer, gracing magazine covers, red carpets and even the pages of Vogue. Ellie’s enhanced profile has created new revenue streams for the Liberty, who restructured their partnership strategy for the mascot, expanding existing – and creating new – partnerships in fashion and other consumer categories, and leveraging Ellie to be featured in multiple digital content series with team partners like Hero, Lyft, Bumble and Xbox. Additionally, Ellie worked with Nike to create a custom colorway for the new Sabrina 2s on sale at [Nike.com](http://Nike.com), was gifted an Off-White look to wear on the player arrival tunnel when the brand announced their partnership with the team and collaborated with Nike/Air Jordan to launch their Nina Chanel collaboration. Trend-setting collaborations like these and more have resulted in a 70% growth in partnership revenue for the Liberty.

Liberty games have become the hottest party in New York with season ticket memberships soaring 152%, attendance at Barclays Center up 64% YoY with 26 sellouts, plus three standing-room only WNBA Finals games – two of which exceeded 18,000 fans. The Liberty also set the record for the highest playoff gate revenue in WNBA history this past season.

Merchandise sales have skyrocketed with Ellie plush dolls – sold for the first time this year – selling out in the first game they were available. The team also began selling Ellie braids, which rapidly sold out, and overall, in-arena merchandise sales are up 101% on game days and 241% on non-game days, while e-commerce revenue has grown an astounding 416%.

The Liberty have also prioritized connecting with new audiences in unique ways to gain widespread appeal beyond the sports world. This includes increasing accessibility to the action on the court through a historic deal with premier city network, WNYW FOX 5, that resulted in triple digit growth in viewership for locally televised games and a recently announced multiyear contract extension.

In another effort to expand the team’s reach, the Liberty launched a direct-to-consumer streaming platform, ‘Liberty Live’ – one of the first WNBA teams to do so – and partnered with Deloitte to refresh their mobile app to prioritize the fan experience through curated player-first content, bringing the modern fan closer to their favorite players. To further elevate their athletes, the Liberty also expanded their player marketing efforts, allowing fans to get to know their favorite players off-the-court. On social, fan engagement across platforms spiked 665% and the Liberty ranked Top 3 in the league for total engagement on Instagram and Twitter.

To further build the team’s fanbase in the community, the Liberty looked to their own backyard – hosting theme nights curated to reflect the diversity of New York City, enlisting New York-born performers for halftime performances, and tapping New York’s very own Alicia Keys to voiceover a championship video. The team also intuitively took advantage of the Olympic break by hosting Summerpalooza – a series of community events, which included free basketball clinics for more than 1,300 youth.

wnba,Liberty to move Barclays Center in Brooklyn for 2020,,46,11,2019-10-17,https://reddit.com/r/wnba/comments/dj7e7d/liberty_to_move_barclays_center_in_brooklyn_for/
wnba,Tsai family ownership guides NY Liberty to top of WNBA,"(July 19): The New York Liberty has become one of the most successful women’s basketball franchises, with its owners’ breaking rules in a bid to treat the team the same as the men.
Billionaire Joe Tsai, co-founder of web giant Alibaba, and wife Clara Wu Tsai, acquired the team in January 2019 from New York Knicks owner James Dolan and began enacting a plan to invest in the team and turn the afterthought into a hot ticket. At the time, they were outliers. The WNBA was struggling. Franchises received little attention from owners who were more focused on the NBA teams they ran.

But now with booming interest in women’s basketball — partly sparked by phenom Caitlin Clark — the Liberty are well-positioned to capitalise. The latest outcropping of that push to elevate the franchise is that they are building the team its own practice gym, according to people familiar with the plans. That would make the Liberty the only team with an NBA counterpart — the Tsais also own the Brooklyn Nets — to get a training facility. The Las Vegas Aces and Seattle Storm have their own, but are independent clubs.

We just knew that there were some very special qualities about this team,” Wu Tsai said in an interview, while pointing out the inherent value of playing in the biggest US media market.
The team showed off some of that specialness during a home game this week — the last matchup before almost a month-long break for the Olympics and this weekend’s All-Star game. The Liberty didn’t have two starters because of injury, including reigning MVP Breanna Stewart, and still knocked off the Connecticut Sun in a battle of top teams.

The Liberty now sit on top of the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) standings after winning 21 of 25 games, giving them a shot at the league record of 34 wins in a season — set last year by the Aces, who beat the Liberty in the Finals.

That’s quite the contrast from just a few years ago. The team has had periods of success since debuting as an original WNBA franchise in 1997, but it bottomed out in 2020 in winning only two games in a season shortened by Covid. The turnaround on the court has been driven by good drafting and luring free agents, including a courtship of Stewart last year that included Wu Tsai leading a delegation to recruit her in Turkey where she played in the offseason.

Sabrina Ionescu, a star guard drafted with top overall pick in 2020, said she’s realised how well Liberty players are treated after hearing about the experiences of peers around the league. The 26-year-old has only known the Tsais as owners and is used to having amenities, like housing and nutrition options, on par with the men’s side.

“It’s super important for free agents and players around the league to know,” said Ionescu, who pointed to the Tsais attending her wedding as a sign of their dedication to the players. “They value us as people, and that is something that I cherish.”

Treating the Liberty equally to the Nets was apparent in the second half of the 2022 season when the Tsais began chartering flights for the team. The WNBA didn’t allow such a move because it might create a competitive advantage because not all owners could afford — or be willing to pay — the pricier flights to away games. The league fined the Liberty US$500,000 (RM2.33 million) for violating the collective bargaining agreement. But charter flights became standard in the league this season.

After acquiring the Liberty, the Tsais inked a deal to buy the rest of the Nets — they had purchased a minority stake in 2017 — and the Barclays Center in the heart of Brooklyn. That allowed them to move the Liberty to Barclays, which has a capacity of almost 18,000, from a puny Westchester stadium north of the city that seated a few thousand fans. The previous ownership made that team’s home when the franchise was put up for sale after years at Madison Square Garden.

The pandemic delayed the move to Brooklyn and building a new fanbase, but that quickly changed. The team pitched games as family-friendly and affordable. To increase player visibility, Wu Tsai produced a documentary on the team’s history. And this season, she worked to make all Liberty games that aren’t on national TV free to stream or broadcast to anyone in the tri-state area.

The Liberty also expanded its partnership with Fanatics to increase merchandise offerings. Sales on game days have jumped about 150% compared to this time last year.

One of the Liberty’s most successful marketing ploys has been its evocative mascot, Ellie the Elephant. The internet sensation has more followers on social media than nearly half the team.

Maintaining fan engagement through community events is also on the agenda for this summer, while the WNBA goes on hiatus for the Olympics. The team plans to host Paris 2024 watch parties and its first summer camp in Brooklyn.

These strategies have paid off: Attendance has surged 63% this season. The franchise is on pace to increase ticket revenue by 70% with the average ticket price up by roughly a third. That’s alongside two straight years of 30% gains in corporate sponsorships. Total revenue is the highest in the league at US$18 million, according to Sportico. The team declined to comment on its financial figures.

The Liberty is also the first team in the WNBA to have a premium seating waitlist.
“We are completely sold out of our courtside seats,” said New York Liberty chief executive officer Keia Clarke. “That’s scarcity.”",45,19,2024-07-19,https://reddit.com/r/wnba/comments/1e754vj/tsai_family_ownership_guides_ny_liberty_to_top_of/

GoNets,22 Days Until Brooklyn Basketball. #22 Caris LeVert.,"Young Caris coming into the season with a lot of hope and expectation - lets show him some love for his third season as a Net!

&amp;#x200B;

Wiki: Caris Coleman LeVert (born August 25, 1994) is an American professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Michigan Wolverines. As a freshman for the 2012–13 team, he nearly redshirted but earned a key role off the bench as the team went on to reach the championship game in the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. As a sophomore for the 2013–14 team, he became a regular starter and was selected as a second team 2013–14 All-Big Ten player for the outright Big Ten regular season champions. His junior and senior seasons were interrupted by injury. LeVert is a cousin of Eddie Levert, Gerald Levert and Sean Levert.

&amp;#x200B;

LeVert grew up in Northeast Columbus but moved to nearby Pickerington in second grade. One of his teammates at Pickerington High School Central was future Ohio State forward Jae'Sean Tate. As a high school senior, he led Pickerington Central to a 26–2 record and the 2012 OHSAA Division I state championship. LeVert was a 2012 Associated Press All-Ohio Second Team high school basketball player and the 2012 Columbus Dispatch Metro Player of the Year for Pickerington High School Central. He was not heavily recruited in high school and his only official visit was to Alabama State. He committed to play basketball for John Groce and the Ohio Bobcats men's basketball program in November 2011. Meanwhile, when future teammates Mitch McGary and Nik Stauskas joined Glenn Robinson III by committing to Michigan in November 2011, Michigan became the fifth best recruiting class in the country.

&amp;#x200B;

When Groce got hired by Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball in March 2012, LeVert got lost in the shuffle and decided to commit to Michigan. Ironically, Groce's 2011–12 Ohio Bobcats' upset of the 2011–12 Michigan team in the 2012 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament was probably the reason that Groce was hired by Illinois and LeVert withdrew his National Letter of Intent to play for Ohio.

&amp;#x200B;

The 2011–12 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team had been co-champions of 2011–12 Big Ten Conference, but lost both of its co-captains, Zack Novak and Stu Douglass, to graduation and three players as transfers. The team was returning a nucleus of All-Big Ten players Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway, Jr.

&amp;#x200B;

LeVert arrived at Michigan weighing 152 pounds (68.9 kg). As a freshman, he began the year behind Stauskas, Robinson, Tim Hardaway, Jr., and Matt Vogrich on the depth chart for the shooting guard/small forward positions and did not play in the first six games as a result. LeVert was a part of an incoming class that included McGary, Stauskas, Robinson, and Spike Albrecht. Eventually, Michigan head coach John Beilein decided that LeVert had value as a perimeter defender and decided to play him rather than redshirt him. On December 1 against Bradley Beilein juggled his lineup: Stauskas made his first career regular season start and LeVert saw his first action. By late December, LeVert became the one-on-one partner for Burke after practices. LeVert made his first start on December 29 against Central Michigan, when Tim Hardaway, Jr. was unavailable. The 3 freshmen in the starting lineup—Robinson, Stauskas and LeVert—combined for 48 points, 12 rebounds and 8 assists. That night LeVert tallied 9 points and 5 assists. LeVert averaged 2.3 points in under 11 minutes of play per game. He never scored in double digits as a freshman, but he scored 8 points each in conference wins over Illinois and Michigan State as well as the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament final four victory over Syracuse in 21 minutes of play.

&amp;#x200B;

LeVert's classmates all made names for themselves as freshmen. During the Spring and Summer semesters (the offseason) of 2013 LeVert and Stauskas trained together on the court and in the weight room. He followed fellow Columbus native and National Player of the Year Burke as a key contributor to Michigan basketball as a sophomore. After opening the season with career-highs of 17 points and 5 rebounds on November 8 against UMass Lowell, he posted 24 points on November 12 against South Carolina State. When Michigan played (#10 AP Poll/ #8 Coaches' Poll) Duke in the ACC–Big Ten Challenge on December 3, LeVert again posted 24 points, including a 7–7 free throw performance. On January 18, Michigan defeated (#3 AP/#3 Coaches) Wisconsin at the Kohl Center for the first time since the 1998–99 team did so on February 27, 1999. It was the highest ranked team Michigan has ever beaten on the road. LeVert contributed a career-high 4 steals and 20 points. LeVert posted his first double double on January 30 at home against Purdue with a career-high 11 rebounds and 14 points. On February 16, Michigan lost to (#21/21) Wisconsin, despite a career-high 25 points from LeVert. Michigan clinched its first outright (unshared) Big Ten Conference championship since 1985–86. He was a 2014 second team 2013–14 All-Big Ten selection (coaches and media). On March 11 LeVert was named to the all-District V (OH, IN, IL, MI, MN, WI) team by the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA). The 2013–14 team was eliminated in the elite eight round of the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament by Kentucky. LeVert and teammate Stauskas, joined Julius Randle, Aaron Harrison and Marcus Lee on the All-Midwest Regional team.

&amp;#x200B;

On May 12, LeVert underwent surgery to repair a stress fracture in his foot. He was expected to be sidelined for 8–10 weeks, but be available for the team's August trip to play in Europe. LeVert returned to action just before the team's August 15–24 10-day, 4-game trip to Italy.

&amp;#x200B;

Prior to the 2014–15 season, LeVert was named a first team All-Big Ten preseason selection along with Frank Kaminsky, Yogi Ferrell, Terran Petteway, and Sam Dekker.\[49\] LeVert was selected by [NBCSports.com](https://NBCSports.com) to its Preseason All-American first team, by SB Nation,\[50\] Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook,\[51\] Athlon Sports,\[52\] Bleacher Report,\[53\] Sports Illustrated,\[54\] and [CBSSports.com](https://CBSSports.com) to their second teams and by USA Today to its third team.\[55\]\[56\]\[57\] In its preseason top 100 player ranking, LeVert was listed at number 13 by ESPN.\[58\] He was also listed as a John R. Wooden Award Preseason Top 50 candidate.\[59\] LeVert also was named to the Oscar Robertson Trophy Watch List on November 24.\[60\] He was also included in the early December Naismith Award top 50 watch list.\[61\]

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

LeVert was named co-captain of the team along with Spike Albrecht. He opened the season with 9 assists against Hillsdale College on November 15, surpassing his previous career-high of five. On November 24, against Oregon, LeVert established a career high by making 11 free throws helping the team to a 70–63 victory in the Legends Classic semifinal game. He posted a career-high 32 points and tied a career-high 4 steals on December 6 in an upset loss to NJIT. He posted 4 steals again against Minnesota on January 10. On January 17 against Northwestern, he reinjured the foot that he had had surgery on the prior May and was lost for the season. At the time of his injury, LeVert led Michigan in scoring (14.9), rebounds (4.9), assists (3.7), steals (1.7) and minutes (35.8). LeVert was on crutches until early March and in a protective walking boot until early April.

&amp;#x200B;

LeVert had been expected to be a 2015 NBA Draft selection, but following his injury some felt his draft stock was impaired. Following the season, he sought advice from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee, but decided that he needed a second evaluation from them as the field of declared underclassmen became more clear with the thinking that ""I don't think it really makes sense to (leave school) early and get drafted in the second round"". On April 21, LeVert announced that he would return for his senior season. According to [CBSSports.com](https://CBSSports.com)'s Sam Vecenie, this would give LeVert a chance to improve his pick and roll decision making, his midrange offensive game and his defense, especially against screens.

&amp;#x200B;

Prior to the 2015–16 season, LeVert was named an All-Big Ten preseason selection, for the second straight year. LeVert became the fourth Wolverine to earn the award multiple times in their career, following Maurice Taylor, LaVell Blanchard and Manny Harris. He was also one of five All-Big Ten preseason selections according to the Big Ten Network. He was one of three Big Ten selections to the 20-man Jerry West Award preseason watchlist (along with James Blackmon, Jr. and Rasheed Sulaimon) announced by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He was an Athlon Sports Preseason All-American 3rd team selection. In preseason top 100 player rankings LeVert was ranked 16 by ESPN and 23 by NBC Sports. He made the initial 50-man John R. Wooden Award watch list on November 17. On December 2, Levert earned recognition on the 50-man Naismith College Player of the Year watchlist and 33-man Robertson Trophy watchlists.

&amp;#x200B;

After being sidelined for the final 14 games of the prior season for the 2014–15 Wolverines, LeVert began the season with a game-high 18 points and 5 assists as a starter against Northern Michigan. On November 16 against Elon, LeVert tied his career high with four steals. On December 5 against Houston Baptist, LeVert made his first start at point guard while Derrick Walton sat out due to a sprained ankle and posted 25 points and 8 rebounds. On December 8, Michigan lost 82–58 to (19/-) SMU as LeVert slumped on 1–13 field goal shooting and 3–6 free throw shooting. On December 15 against Northern Kentucky, LeVert posted 13 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, becoming the fourth player in Michigan program history to record a triple-double, and the 49th Wolverine to eclipse 1,000 career points. Based on his triple double against Northern Kentucky and a 19-point effort against Youngstown State, LeVert earned Co-Big Ten Player of the Week honors (along with Malcolm Hill) on December 21. On December 30, Michigan defeated Illinois 78–68 in its Big Ten Conference opener as LeVert posted a 22-point, 10-assist double-double. LeVert missed the January 2 game against Penn State with a lower left leg injury. At the time, he was the team leader in points, rebounds and assists.

&amp;#x200B;

On January 13, LeVert was one of four Big Ten athletes (along with Melo Trimble, Jarrod Uthoff and Denzel Valentine) among the 25 players included in the Wooden Award Midseason Top 25 Watch List. On the eve of LeVert's sixth missed game, head coach Beilein finally clarified that LeVert's left leg injury was not related to the two previous left foot stress fractures that LeVert had endured. On February 2, LeVert was one of two Big Ten athletes (along with Malcolm Hill) named one of 10 finalists for the Jerry West Award, despite having missed the last 8 of Michigan's 22 games. On February 10, Brendan F. Quinn of [MLive.com](https://MLive.com) broke the story that LeVert had been cleared to play. On February 13, Michigan defeated (#18/16) Purdue 61–56 with LeVert recording five rebounds and one assist in 11 minutes after missing the previous 11 games. On March 1, the team announced that the injury would end LeVert's season and collegiate career. On March 22, LeVert had a third surgical procedure in 22 months performed on his left foot in New York City by specialist Dr. Martin O'Malley. By late April, the draft stock of LeVert had slipped to the second round. According to the Michigan Basketball Twitter feed, he attended graduation in crutches at the end of April. He was invited to the May 11–15 NBA Draft Combine. While still on crutches at the combine, LeVert clarified that his injury was a Jones fracture of the fifth metatarsal and that Kevin Durant who has the same agency and used the same doctor had called to offer him encouragement.

&amp;#x200B;

The day before the 2016 NBA draft, LeVert authored an open letter to NBA general managers to assure them of his resiliency in the face of all of his doubters due to his injury.\[132\] On June 23, LeVert was selected with the 20th overall pick in the 2016 draft by the Indiana Pacers. He became Michigan's fifth first-round draft selection since 2013 and the fourth player drafted from Michigan's 2012 entering class.\[133\]\[134\] His rights were later traded to the Brooklyn Nets on July 7, in exchange for Thaddeus Young.\[135\] Dr. O'Malley, who had performed LeVert's most recent foot surgery, was on the Brooklyn Nets medical staff at the time of the trade.\[136\]\[137\] On July 14, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Nets.\[138\] LeVert missed the 2016 NBA Summer League as well as preseason and resumed practicing near the beginning of the regular season.\[139\] He began the season sidelined and still rehabbing his injury.\[140\] He was cleared to play on December 4.\[141\]\[142\] He made his professional debut on December 7 against the Denver Nuggets. Although he went 0-of-3 from the field, he posted 4 rebounds and 3 steals in 9 minutes of play, becoming the first Net to post 3 steals in his debut since Chris Childs in 1994. Levert entered at the start of the second quarter and posted 3 steals and 3 rebounds in 5:15 of play before halftime. LeVert scored his first NBA points on December 10 against the San Antonio Spurs on a back door reverse layup assisted by Brook Lopez. LeVert posted double digit scoring for the first time with 12 points on December 30 against the Washington Wizards and former Michigan one-on-one training partner Burke's season-high 27 points. On February 3, Levert made his first NBA start against former Michigan teammate Robinson and the Indiana Pacers. On April 6 against the Orlando Magic, LeVert posted his first 20-point performance. Despite missing a large portion of the season, LeVert almost made the NBA All-Rookie team, finishing 12 in the voting for the 10-man team.

&amp;#x200B;

When Jeremy Lin was sidelined for the 2017–18 NBA season after the first game, it opened up playing time. After Allen Crabbe started game 2, LeVert entered the starting lineup for game 3 on October 22 against the Atlanta Hawks, posting 16 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals. Coming off the bench on November 6 against the Phoenix Suns,he posted a 5-steal performance, while locking down Devin Booker so well that he frustrated Booker into fouling out. With injuries to point guards Jeremy Lin and D'Angelo Russell, coach Kenny Atkinson was impressed with LeVert rising to the challenge of learning a new position, earning the back-up point guard role to Spencer Dinwiddie. On December 7 (the first anniversary of his NBA debut), he had career highs in points (21) and assists (10) against reigning NBA MVP Russell Westbrook to lead the Nets to a 100–95 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder in Mexico City. Although his performance was highlighted by his first NBA double-double on offense, he was also praised for his 2-steal/2-block/5-rebound effort on defense against Westbrook. On December 27 against the New Orleans Pelicans, LeVert set another career high with 22 points. Two days later, he recorded 12 points and a career-high 11 assists in a 111–87 win over the Miami Heat. Then, LeVert had a few minor injuries (groin and knee) in January and February, that caused him to miss a total of 10 games over 3 separate stretches. On March 4, 2018, he had a 27-point effort in a 123–120 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. Levert posted a career-high 12 rebounds along with 19 points on March 31, against the Miami Heat.

&amp;#x200B;

LeVert is the son of Kim and Darryl LeVert and has one sibling, Darryl, who is his junior by 11 months. His mother is a Columbus City Schools first grade teacher. His father, who was a graphic designer, died on April 4, 2010 at the age of 46. As of February 2014, his brother, Darryl, played basketball for Connors State College. LeVert comes from a musical family as he is the third cousin of Eddie LeVert, the lead vocalist of the O'Jays. Eddie's sons include singers Gerald LeVert of LSG and LeVert (along with Sean LeVert).

GoNets,Shams: Rockets have no interest in Nets offer,"from his latest article on The Athletic 

&gt; The Rockets don’t have an urgency to move Harden and the franchise expects a mammoth package for the six-time All-NBA first team performer: along the lines of a young star and tremendous draft assets. *Sources said the Rockets have no interest in a Nets offer, unless it would include either Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving.* The 76ers want to view their two young All-Stars, Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid, under new head coach Doc Rivers — who has raved about both players and has privately made clear he wants the opportunity to have elevated success with both Simmons and Embiid — and centered around president of basketball operations Daryl Morey’s new acquisitions such as veteran shooters Danny Green and Seth Curry and key reserve center Dwight Howard. Rivers has spoken highly about the championship experience Howard and Green will provide after winning a title with the Los Angeles Lakers in October. In theory, however, Houston could wait out the potential availability of Simmons should Philadelphia get off to a slow start.

&gt;The 76ers and Nets remain at the top of Harden’s preferred destinations, sources said. Milwaukee and Miami represent two other East contenders.

so basically, It’s officially dead. The only chance the nets had of landing Harden was if Harden didn’t budge on his trade demand and scared everyone else away from trading for him.",45,36,2020-12-10,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/kag4su/shams_rockets_have_no_interest_in_nets_offer/
GoNets,Lakers fan here who stopped by earlier offering the discounted ticket for the section next to the visitors' tunnel. I had a really great experience cheering on the Nets,"I got to see Dlo and Dinwiddie play pretty good games (I thought he was gonna go for a career high when he scored the first 6 or 8 Nets points by himself). I love how Brooklyn played more team ball passing to everyone, which was a contrast to what the Wizards were doing. I appreciated Dlo vividly cheering on his team when he was not playing. 

I got Jared Dudley to acknowledge me at halftime when I yelled his name, and I was literally one person away trom shaking hands with Dlo (lucky guy). All in all, it was a great experience attending my very first Nets game. ",44,4,2018-11-17,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/9xsx53/lakers_fan_here_who_stopped_by_earlier_offering/
GoNets,Good amount of Nets alum playing in Puerto Rico.,"I used to watch other NBA games on League Pass when we had off-nights.  Now I just focus on the Nets and not much else around the league.  Instead I've been watching basketball from Puerto Rico on Youtube (Baloncesto Superior Nacional)  and a lot of familiar names, including some recent former Nets.  

Ed Davis, Mitch Creek, Jacob Wiley is looking like Nick Clax in the league.  Remember him? He was our first two-way player.  He plays for Bayamon, the team owned by Cardinals legend Yadier Molina.   
 Shabazz Napier was there earlier but went to Europe.  Even former Nets summer league invitee Brandon Knight is there.  

There's also Hassan Whiteside, Norris Cole, Tyreke Evans.  So the level of play is entertaining.   Crowds are into it and fun.  I'm enjoying it.  I just wanted to share about the former Nets doing their thing.",44,18,2023-04-07,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/12e5wed/good_amount_of_nets_alum_playing_in_puerto_rico/

wnba,LOLA Partners with the New York Liberty and Barclays Center to Provide Free Organic Period Care,"LOLA, a company focused on organic feminine care and reproductive wellness, has announced a new partnership with Barclays Center and the New York Liberty, the 2024 WNBA champions. As part of this collaboration, complimentary LOLA products will now be available in restrooms for all events at Barclays Center, marking the first time the Brooklyn arena will provide feminine care products free to guests.

“At LOLA, we believe that safe period care products with clean ingredients should be accessible in all restrooms, venues, and public and private spaces,” said Kelly Murphy, GM of LOLA. “Our partnership with Barclays Center and the New York Liberty is a significant step in supporting the everyday wellness of athletes and fans, and we’re excited to support their mission to provide young girls with the care and resources they need to participate in sports at all levels.”

Catherine Carlson, Executive Vice President of Global Partnerships at BSE Global, added, “We are thrilled to partner with LOLA, an organization that shares our commitment to empowering the local community and inspiring the next generation of athletes. The New York Liberty and Barclays Center are proud to support and uplift girls in sports by removing barriers to participation, helping them stay active, strong, and confident.

The partnership extends beyond product placement. LOLA will collaborate with the Liberty’s Brooklyn Basketball youth program, elevating select basketball clinics across New York City’s five boroughs. These clinics will focus on leadership training, athletic coaching, and goal-setting workshops, with complimentary LOLA products provided to participants.

Recognizing that menstrual cycles can be a barrier to sports participation, the collaboration aims to provide girls with the information and products they need to continue playing sports. Barclays Center’s decision to offer LOLA’s 100% organic cotton products aligns with its commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility.

GoNets,[OC] How the Celtics slowed down Kevin Durant in Game 1 (Analysis/Film Study),"Celtics vs Nets was the best first round series opener in recent memory. It may have been the best first round game in the last decade, opener or not. It came with a masterclass from Kyrie Irving, drama from the crowd, a vintage Al Horford game, and an ending for the ages.

Sometimes, it is best to just sit back and enjoy a basketball game instead of finding a narrative or overanalyzing everything. In a vacuum, this was one of those games. In reality, we still have a long way to go in this series and this game can tell us a lot about what we will see moving forward. So let's take a look at one of the biggest stories coming out of this game. Kevin Durant’s off night.

Despite excellent work on Durant, this was far from an excellent defensive game for the Celtics by their standards. They missed rotations, had miscommunications, and gave up easy open transition shots, all of which are extremely uncharacteristic for the Celtics most of the time.

Those issues matter, and if they persist going forwards in this series I may examine exactly what went wrong. But for now, the most surprising aspect of the Boston defense was not what went wrong. It was how well they stifled Kevin Durant, a man who is generally unshakeable and unguardable.

So how’d they do it? It started with one thing. Physicality. The playoffs have always been more physical than the regular season, especially when it comes to contact off the ball. We could see the refs start punishing that aggressiveness, but I don’t anticipate things changing dramatically.

One of the Nets’ favorite ways to get Kevin Durant is to give him a pindown screen and have him curl around it to catch it around the elbow. If you can't make that action difficult you don’t have a chance, once he gets the ball there and has a second to set his feet that midrange shot is essentially a layup. If you let him get there you need to get into his body before he gets into the air or pray he misses. Shockingly, that strategy doesn’t work often. The Celtics went the other way, committing to keeping the ball out of his hands during that action with switches and soft double teams.

When a team defends those pindowns like the Celtics did, you really have two options. You can go away from the play entirely and find either way to get KD the ball. You can attempt to exploit the defense’s choice by finding the big man setting the screen as he rolls to the rim. It’s a difficult pass, but it’s possible, and it can force the defense to adjust. The final possibility is having KD reset all the way to the perimeter and attack whichever big man switched onto him with some isolation offense. That’s what Brooklyn did time and time again in game one, and it almost never worked.

The Celtics switched more than any other team in the league, and it was a big part of why they ended the season as the best defense in the league. They can afford to switch for a few reasons. First off, everyone on the court can guard multiple positions. Marcus Smart can guard big men and Al Horford can guard some of the quickest players in the league when need be. Secondly, The Celtics communicate very well. Much of that credit should fall to Marcus Smart, a man who’s perimeter defense and communication skills earned him the Defensive Player of the Year Award. Finally, and arguably most important, the Celtics have help defense behind the primary defender. It doesn’t matter who that perimeter defender is. Jayson Tatum has quick hands, a good ability to read passes, and the athleticism to block shots when he needs it. Al Horford is a surprisingly quick big man and statistically one of the best isolation defenders off switches in the league

Once Kevin Durant had the ball in the perimeter, the Celtics forced him into the lane, where multiple defenders were always prepared to swipe at the ball and contest shots. This play is a perfect example. Grant Williams plays good, physical defense, forcing Durant into the busy lane. Once he gets there, Marcus Smart is ready to pounce on the ball and get the steal. Even if Durant had kept the ball from Smart, Horford was in great position to contest any type of shot at the rim. The Celtics have a lot of good individual defenders, but that’s not enough for Durant. You need to play as a team.

https://reddit.com/link/u80jdp/video/pxl6jj35opu81/player

The other problem for Durant was that the Celtics consistently knew where he wanted to go. Durant has a few spots he loves to get to, but when everyone knows where those spots are, good defenders can take advantage. Durant loves to take pull-up mid rangers from the right elbow, so the Celtics ran him off of that shot like he was Steph Curry at the three point line. On this play, (after some physical off-ball defense by Williams and Horford, Durant goes to that same shot, only to find that Williams was ready to swipe down and take the ball away as soon as Durant elevated for his shot.

https://reddit.com/link/u80jdp/video/3ibrrgt5opu81/player

Later in the game, the Nets forced a switch and then put the defender on an island by spreading out the floor and making it harder for the Celtics to help. The problem with that plan was that Al Horford put in an incredible performance defensively. He was repeatedly tasked with guarding KD, and not only did he take on the challenge, he welcomed it. Other Celtics helped when possible, but those opportunities were few and far between. Horford was a perfect blend of physical and disciplined, using his length to contest every shot Durant got off. On this play, Horford shifts his feet perfectly to stay in front of Durant, uses his body to stifle a blowby attempt, and then contests a midranger perfectly.

https://reddit.com/link/u80jdp/video/8cu69za8opu81/player

The switching defense was huge, but it only matters when Durant needs to force a switch in the first place. Only a few players can be effective as the primary defender for a full game, and even fewer can do that while shouldering a massive load offensively. Jayson Tatum is one of those few players. He played excellent defense on Durant, contested everything without fouling, and even blocked jumpshots by both Durant and Irving. There were a lot of examples of Tatum playing great defense on Durant, but none were quite as important as the final offensive possession for Brooklyn. Not only does Tatum move his feet well to keep KD in front of him, but he withstands a clear push off from the right hand of Durant before making up the lost space and making a picture perfect contest on the deep three-point shot. It doesn’t get much better than that.

https://reddit.com/link/u80jdp/video/jbxggrd9opu81/player

Kevin Durant will not shoot 37.5% from the field every game. That much is clear. But the Celtics defense has been elite for a long time, and there has been nothing to suggest that will change now. Whether or not Durant steps it up moving forward, he will have to work harder than ever to find opportunities to score. The Celtics have elite defenders all across the court, rotate intelligently and quickly, and have the ability to change defensive style on the fly whenever it is necessary. Game two is happening tonight, and Kevin Durant’s ability to find open space and get in rhythm could be the difference. The Celtics will make it tough, but if anyone can do it, it’s Kevin Durant.

GoNets,Nets Seeding Scenarios,"Hey guys, I'm a C's fan but since our teams might face off in the playoffs (which I definitely don't want), then I calculated the scenarios in which the Nets finish in the 7/8/9/10 seeds:

""To bring up the Nets possibility; essentially here's how the Nets can finish, because regular-season wise 7 is pretty much dead for them. The Hornets do have the tiebreaker on them, but the Hawks don't and in the event of a 3-way tie, the Nets finish at 8 due to conference record:

**7 seed**: CLE goes 0-3  
*If BKN goes 4-0*, then ATL/CHA go 3-1 or worse  
**8 seed**: CLE goes 1-2 or better  
*If BKN goes 1-3*, then ATL goes 0-4 AND CHA goes 1-3 (if ATL goes 0-4) or 0-4  
*If BKN goes 2-2*, then ATL goes 1-3 or 0-4 AND CHA goes 2-2 (if ATL goes 1-3) or worse  
*If BKN goes 3-1*, then ATL goes 2-2 or worse AND CHA goes 3-1 (if ATL goes 2-2) or worse

GoNets,31 Days Until Brooklyn Basketball. #31 Jarrett Allen.,"Let's showcase one of our most promising rookies from last season, Jarrett Allen!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Wiki: Jarrett Allen (born April 21, 1998) is an American professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets for the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Texas Longhorns.

&amp;#x200B;

Allen attended St. Stephen's Episcopal School in Austin, Texas where he went on to win two SPC championships. He played in the 2016 McDonald's All-American Boys Game. He committed to the University of Texas at Austin to play college basketball.

&amp;#x200B;

As a freshman at Texas, Allen averaged 13.4 points and 8.4 rebounds per game. However, Texas finished a disappointing 11-22. His best game was a 22-point, 19-rebound performance in a 12-point loss to Kansas. After the season, he entered the 2017 NBA draft but did not initially hire an agent before deciding to forgo his remaining three years of collegiate eligibility.

&amp;#x200B;

Allen was selected with the 22nd overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft by the Brooklyn Nets. On July 20 he signed his rookie scale deal with the Nets. Allen was 19 years 182 days when he made his NBA debut on October 20, thus becoming the second-youngest player to ever step foot on court for the Nets, just behind Derrick Favors. He finished the game with nine points on 3-for-3 shooting, two rebounds, and one block. On January 25, 2018, Allen joined the starting lineup for the first time and recorded a career high 16 points and 12 rebounds in a 116-108 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. On February 2, 2018, in a game against the Los Angeles Lakers, Allen scored a career-high 20 points, as well as five rebounds and one block. On March 21, 2018, Allen recorded four blocks, which matched his career high, as well as six rebounds, and 9 points in a 111-105 loss to the Charlotte Hornets.

GoNets,Sean Marks is about to pull off the ultimate heist,"One of my favorite Sean Marks moves that he's ever done is when he signed Tyler Zeller to a minimum contract, then put him in Atkinson's system which made him look good enough to be traded for Rashad Vaughn and a 2018 2nd rounder.  The Nets then traded that 2nd rounder and their own 2021 2nd rounder to dump Mozgov's contract at the expense of Dwight Howard's $18,919,725 in dead cap.  Vaughn was also traded for Cunningham, a vet who fit the team and system very well in his one year on the roster.

Marks has been collecting assets and taking on salary dumps for some time now, and he is about to pull off the ultimate heist.  In 2017, Marks traded Trevor Booker for Jahlil Okafor, Nik Stauskas, and NYK unprotected 2019 2nd rounder.  Okafor and Stauskas are both off the roster now.  Then in 2018, Marks took part in a 3-team trade in which the Nets traded away Jeremy Lin, Isaiah Whitehead, the rights to swap 2023 2nd rounders with Atlanta, and their 2025 2nd rounder for DEN 2019 1st rounder, Kenneth Faried, Darrell Arthur, DEN 2020 2nd rounder, and the rights to Isaia Cordinier.  He then traded Darrell Arthur for Jared Dudley and 2021 PHX 2nd rounder.

Why is this all relevant?  After the demands and frustration that Jimmy Butler has put on the Timberwolves, they are not going to get a good return for him.  I think it's 100% possible for the Nets to acquire Butler WHILE STILL KEEPING D'Lo, Crabbe, LeVert, Hollis-Jefferson, Allen, etc.  The Timberwolves will see that they are talking with two teams in the Knicks and Clippers who have little draft capital to offer (Knicks traded their 2019-2021 2nd rounders away but acquired new 2019-2021 2nd rounders, Clippers actually traded away their 2019 1st rounder).  The Nets will then swoop in with this offer: Kenneth Faried, Jared Dudley, DEN 2019 1st, NYK 2019 2nd for Jimmy Butler.  Minnesota will hate the offer initially, but eventually realize that that is the best offer they are going to get for the rebuild they are expecting.  Sean Marks is really about to turn Trevor Booker, Jeremy Lin, Isaiah Whitehead, pick swap of 2023 2nd rounder, 2025 2nd rounder into Jimmy Butler, DEN 2020 2nd rounder, PHX 2021 2nd rounder, and the rights to Isaia Cordinier.",40,16,2018-09-20,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/9hhp0y/sean_marks_is_about_to_pull_off_the_ultimate_heist/
GoNets,Top 5 Nets Memories,"This sub has been toxic lately, the vibes are bad and we’re like passengers stranded on an island after a plane crash. Work’s been slow, kid’s in daycare, so I wanted to do a positive Nets related exercise for myself as they’ve been a big part of my life and now sharing it with you.

Hope we all can take a step back and realize, this is only a moment in Nets history and no matter how grim it looks now, it will get better, unless they move us away from the area. **Also fuck the Knicks.**


Would love to hear about what your favorite memories are of your time as a Nets fan. Here are mine in order from when it happened:

1. **Any alley-oop from Jason Kidd to Kenyon Martin.** There is no other play I would use to exemplify what the early 2000s Nets were. In an era of isolation and slow play, they were a fast break energy team, led by the dynamic duo of Kidd and Kenyon. Their signature off the backboard alley oop would send the crowd into the frenzy and send a spark into the rest of the team. Felt like one of the 3rd quarter Warrior runs where everyone suddenly became in-sync. Kidd was the conductor of the whole team, but Kenyon was the heart and soul.

Here’s some alley oops: https://youtu.be/D3xoDBiEHeY?si=sbAteppLm1uG-_nG



2. **Game 5 of the first round of the 2002 NBA Playoffs against the Pacers.** It’s win or go home, the Nets are up 3 with 5 seconds left, Nets rookie Richard Jefferson steps to the line. He has a chance to send the #1 seeded Nets to the second round, something that hasn’t happened since the 1983-1984 season. He chokes and misses both, the ball gets into his Reggie’s hands and he banks it in after the buzzer from near half court. The refs count it, there’s no in-game replays, the game is going into overtime. The kid in front of me is having a full on meltdown calling for Richard Jefferson to be banned from the state of New Jersey. That might have been the loudest the Continental Airlines Arena ever got. Thankfully, the Nets went on to win in double overtime and make it all the way to the NBA finals.

The play: https://youtu.be/WBhC1gMTsc8?si=e6bqAJz0HYZI3dRS



3. **The last game the Nets played in New Jersey.** The days of Jason Kidd were long gone. You think vibes now are bad? The team not only sucked, but for 2 years we knew this team was being taken away from us. The attendance was consistently bottom 3 in the league and the ticket prices were cheaper than a burger off the McDonald’s dollar menu. The Nets had moved from the Izod Center to Prudential in Newark, a stadium built for a hockey team. I can remember the atmosphere that night, it was the epitome of Chris Christie’s remarks to them leaving “good riddance”.

I certainly have more fond memories of the Nets, but this was the last Nets game I went to with my dad. He’s still alive so its not a sad story, but he refuses to make the trek out to Brooklyn. I was fortunate enough to be able to go to countless games with him growing up. It’s the reason I love the sport of basketball, the reason I love the Nets and always will.

TV Segment of the Final Game: https://youtu.be/_uRe08Gp6NQ?si=uCXFGfoJJZdp1yu6


4. **Kyrie's first game as a Net.** However you feel about the man and how he destroyed this franchise's championship dream, he was in the words of Stephen A Smith, box office. It was a pleasure watching his game on a night to night basis and there was no better night for me than his first game. There was debate amongst Nets fans if we should replace DLo with Kyrie and in one night it became apparent we made the right decision.

Kyrie goes off for 50 points, the Barclays was rocking as he’s making ridiculous 3s, crossovers, and layups. We entered a new era of Nets basketball, and it was going to be a great (as far as we knew). Wanted so badly for that game winner to go in, even so, it was a magical night of Nets basketball. It was one of those games I’ll never forget where I was watching it.

Here's the game: https://youtu.be/B1r6tgpxEwk?si=c37nDydk9RrrJIIj



5. **I got to see the Big 3 in person only one time.** Game 2 of the first round of the 2021 NBA Playoffs against the Celtics. The ball was popping, everyone was in sync, I was witnessing one of the greatest NBA teams in history playing at peak performance. The irony is, the best player in that game was Smoking Joe Harris. He single handily started the blowout with 16 in the first half. Finished with 25 pts and 7 3 pointers. Kinda wish they didn’t blow them out so I could’ve seen more of the Big 3, I remember telling my wife at least we can see them next season…

It made it special that Joe was the one leading this Big 3. He was the only guy left from the rebuild after we lost Dinwiddie (to injury), Levert, Jarrett, and DLo. Felt like a proud father watching his son not only play with the big boys but be the stand out.

Well the Nets started building a big lead and Hornet's defense looked terrible. On offense Howard was looking for post ups and getting called for three second violations. Hornets looked like a mess. It looked like an easy win. 

Well then this guy on the other side of the arena started yelling out at Howard ""You're not Shaq."" It was loud. I could hear it easily on the other side of the arena. The crowd was laughing. The guy wouldn't stop. Other hecklers got into it as well. Again and again they were calling out Howard. 

Well I turned to my GF and said, ""If this guy doesn't stop, Howard is going to get pissed off."" Well, then Howard started dominating and you all know the rest. I'm really pretty sure that heckler lost us the game.

GoNets,43 Days Until Brooklyn Basketball. #43 Kris Humphries.,"A 6 year journeyman turned his career around once he suited up for the Nets in '09-'10 and started to gain minutes with his scoring, rebounding, and overall hustle. Plus you know you've made it when you marry a Kardashian and Kanye comes after you on a track.. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Wiki: Kristopher Nathan Humphries (born February 6, 1985) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He has also played in the NBA for the Utah Jazz, Toronto Raptors, Dallas Mavericks, New Jersey / Brooklyn Nets, Boston Celtics, Washington Wizards, and Phoenix Suns.

Kris Humphries held the US national record for the 50-meter freestyle for 10 and under boys for 18 years until it was recently broken. At age 12 he gave up swimming to pursue a career in basketball.

&amp;#x200B;

Humphries attended Hopkins High School, where he led the team to a 25–2 record in 2002 and its first Minnesota state championship in 49 years.

At Minnesota, Humphries was named 2004 Big Ten Freshman of the Year and named to the All-Big Ten First Team by the media and coaches. He was named Honorable Mention All-America by the Associated Press and by [Rivals.com](https://Rivals.com). He was the first freshman to lead the Big Ten in scoring and rebounding in the same season. He scored in double figures in all 29 games, with 16 point/rebound double-doubles on the season for Minnesota. He averaged 21.7 points and 10.1 rebounds (both tops in the Big Ten), while shooting .444 percent from the field and .742 from the line. On February 18, 2004 he set a school record with 36 points in a game against Indiana. He also set a school record for most points by a freshman for a season with 629 and was the first Big Ten freshman to be named conference Player of the Week in two of the first three weeks of the season. Humphries only played one season for Minnesota before declaring for the NBA Draft.

&amp;#x200B;

Although Humphries was personally successful at Minnesota, the team struggled. The Gophers finished 12–18, with a 3–13 record in the Big Ten during Humphries' lone season, tying Penn State for the worst record in the conference. Critics accused Humphries of playing selfishly, preferring to inflate his statistics and NBA draft stock rather than help the team win games. The team had a .500 record before his arrival and finished with a 10–6 conference record in the season after he left.

&amp;#x200B;

Humphries was drafted by the Utah Jazz with the 14th overall selection in the 2004 NBA draft. He spent two seasons with the Jazz, averaging 3.6 ppg and 2.7 rpg in 11.6 minutes per game.

&amp;#x200B;

On June 8, 2006, Humphries was traded along with Robert Whaley to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Rafael Araújo. In the 2006–07 season, after a slow start in which he did not receive many minutes from Raptors coach Sam Mitchell, Humphries proved to be a valuable rebounder and energy player and contributed to the Raptors capturing their first ever division title. On March 28, 2007, he grabbed seven offensive rebounds in 27 minutes against the Miami Heat, both a game-high and a career-high. He followed up this performance with nine offensive and 18 total rebounds in a win against the Detroit Pistons on April 13, 2007, again both game and career-highs. Humphries concluded his inaugural season with the Raptors with a career-high 3.1 rpg and .470 field goal percentage, as well as 3.8 ppg.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 9, 2009, Humphries, Shawn Marion and Nathan Jawai were traded to the Dallas Mavericks as a part of the four-team deal among Raptors, Mavericks, Orlando Magic and Memphis Grizzlies.

&amp;#x200B;

On January 11, 2010 the Mavericks traded Humphries along with G/F Shawne Williams to the New Jersey Nets in order to re-acquire Eduardo Nájera. On January 27, 2010, Humphries scored a career-high 25 points against the Los Angeles Clippers. He previously recorded career highs of 15 and 21 points respectively as a New Jersey Net. The 2011 season was a breakout season for Humphries as he averaged a double-double in points and rebounds. On December 21, 2011, Humphries signed a one-year, $8 million contract with the New Jersey Nets.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 17, 2012, Humphries signed a two-year, $24 million contract with the Nets, who by that point had moved to Brooklyn.

&amp;#x200B;

On June 27, 2013, [ESPN.com](https://ESPN.com) reported that the Nets and Boston Celtics had worked out a trade that would send Humphries and four other players (Keith Bogans, MarShon Brooks, Kris Joseph and Gerald Wallace) as well as three future first-round draft picks to Boston in exchange for Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Jason Terry as well as D. J. White. The deal was finally completed on July 12, 2013.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 19, 2014, Humphries was acquired by the Washington Wizards in a sign-and-trade deal that sent a protected 2015 second round pick and a trade exception to the Boston Celtics. On October 9, 2014, he underwent successful surgery to repair nerve damage in his right small finger, and was subsequently sidelined for three to four weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

On November 14, 2015, Humphries made 5-of-8 three-pointers on his way to a game-high 23 points, helping the Wizards defeat the Orlando Magic 108–99. Prior to the 2015–16 season, Humphries had gone more than a decade since making a three-pointer. He hit two in his 2004–05 rookie season, and none after that, until this game.

&amp;#x200B;

On February 18, 2016, Humphries was traded, along with DeJuan Blair and a 2016 protected first round draft pick, to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Markieff Morris. He made his debut for the Suns the following day in a 116–100 loss to the Houston Rockets, recording 18 points and 12 rebounds in 27 minutes off the bench, becoming the 13th Suns player to have a double-double in his debut. On February 28, after three starts in four games, he was waived by the Suns in a buyout agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

On March 1, 2016, Humphries signed with the Atlanta Hawks. Three days later, he made his debut for the Hawks in a 106–77 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, recording 14 points, eight rebounds, one steal and one block in 22 minutes off the bench.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 15, 2016, Humphries re-signed with the Hawks.

&amp;#x200B;

On September 25, 2017, Humphries signed with the Philadelphia 76ers but was waived on October 14, 2017, as one of the final roster cuts.

&amp;#x200B;

Humphries began dating reality TV personality Kim Kardashian in October 2010. They became engaged in May 2011, and married on August 20, 2011. A two-part TV special showing the preparations and the wedding itself aired on E! in early October 2011, amidst what The Washington Post called a ""media blitz"" related to the wedding. On October 31, 2011, it was announced that Kardashian had filed for divorce from Humphries after 72 days of marriage. On December 1, 2011, Humphries filed his response to Kardashian's petition, requesting an annulment on the grounds of fraud or a decree of legal separation rather than Kardashian requested divorce. Several news outlets have surmised that Kardashian's marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt for financial gain orchestrated by E! Entertainment, Kris and Kim Kardashian to promote the Kardashian family's brand and their subsequent television ventures. In April 2013, after a lengthy legal battle, Humphries and Kardashian reached a divorce settlement. Their divorce was finalized on June 3, 2013.

&amp;#x200B;

Humphries was on the 2002 U.S. Junior World Championship Qualifying Tournament Team, alongside future Raptors' teammate Chris Bosh. The team finished with a 4–1 record and the bronze medal and qualified for a berth in the 2003 FIBA Junior World Championship. Humphries averaged 9.0 ppg and 5.0 rpg in five games.

GoNets,Seerat Sohi of The Ringer grades every NBA team and is harsh with her her Brooklyn Nets analysis,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Brooklyn Nets: F  
&gt;  
&gt;**Season record: 21-35**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Barclays Center has the energy of a dilapidated WeWork building: empty, aside from spare parts that remind you of the Nets’ once promising auspices and cataclysmic failure, the muted color palette and plain hardwood suggesting a preference for versatility and functionality over a set-in-stone identity. That’s exactly who the Brooklyn Nets, worse in record than talent, are: a team that can’t decide what it wants to be and isn’t doing much of anything as a result.  
&gt;  
&gt;The front office’s decision to fire Jacque Vaughn, who hasn’t commanded much respect—or much of an offense—doesn’t come as a surprise. Vaughn’s sign-off in his farewell to the Nets included the phrase amor fati, meaning “to love one’s fate,” which is a nice sentiment reflecting both his positive spirit and his rudderless approach to X’s and O’s. He always felt like a high-end developmental coach miscast as a head honcho.  
&gt;  
&gt;The guy the Nets want to build their franchise around, Mikal Bridges, expressed frustration with Vaughn all season, from his tepid [response](https://www.si.com/nba/nets/news/mikal-bridges-unhappy-with-brooklyn-nets-rest-choices-against-milwaukee-bucks) to Vaughn’s rest strategies to his advocacy for Cam Thomas to start. Using Bridges, a well-liked and ideal complementary star, as a sweetener to attract bigger fish to Brooklyn works only if he’s buying what he’s selling. I doubt they’d have the juice to entice an unhappy Luka Doncic or even Donovan Mitchell, considering the Knicks’ rise and Cleveland’s recent success. For the sheer theater, it would be incredible if Trae Young played across the bridge from Madison Square Garden. Maybe Brooklynites would start going to games again, just for the treat of booing him? But the Nets have work to do to become an attractive destination again. The Dennis Smith Jr. reclamation project has been the most inspiring thing about the team this season. Maybe interim coach Kevin Ollie—or Mike Budenholzer, whom they could target this summer—can reinvigorate the culture.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can’t help but wonder whether they would have been better off trading Bridges to the Rockets in exchange for the picks they relinquished in the James Harden deal and trading everyone else after that. Now, the Nets are positioned to overpay Nic Claxton to retain him. On the other hand, their stubborn insistence on keeping Kevin Durant as long as they did last season is why they were able to get Bridges, Johnson, and a hoard of picks for him.

nba,"So, the Nets are screwed. Is there any historical analogy? Is there any way out of this??","The longer this season goes on, the clearer it becomes that the Nets are absolutely screwed. Is there any way out of this? We have no cap space, no trade-able assets, no draft picks for the next 5 years - and it looks like we're just absolutely terrible with no path to getting any better.


Would anyone take DWill or Joe or Brook at this point? Are we stuck with all these guys?  What the hell would you do if you were Billy King? Is there anything that can be done? Is the Barclays going to be bare bones empty next year?? I thought it couldn't get any worse than Isiah's Knicks, but this looks much much worse.

GoNets,Michael Scotto and Bobby Marks talk about The Trade deadline.,"**Scotto:** The Nets have been a little too quiet. They’re a team that I would say knows what they are right now. They are open for business and certainly taking calls. They’ve got a glut of wings, **Dorian Finney-Smith**, **Royce O’Neale**. It’s interesting because I feel like if they keep O’Neale, you almost wonder if they’re going to try to make a run at **Donovan Mitchell** because they’re very close friends. Finney-smith is a great player on an affordable contract. He’s a guy who could fit literally on every team, but on a championship contender or high-caliber playoff team, he’d be great. They would want the equivalent of two first-round picks for him, I’m told.

You touched on Dinwiddie. Before the season, Dinwiddie became eligible to do an extension. From what I’m told, they had brief exploratory short-term talks, whether it would’ve been a one-year or a two-year extension. Dinwiddie wanted a longer deal.

You mentioned that it seems like it’s the end of the road for Dinwiddie here for him in round two with the Nets. I would tend to agree. When he attacks downhill, he makes them a better team. He certainly wants to be a part of a team’s core (long-term). We did [**a podcast earlier in the year,**](https://hoopshype.com/lists/nets-spencer-dinwiddie-ben-simmons-cam-thomas-cam-johnson-kevin-durant-james-harden-free-agency/) and he made it clear that if he left, he’d leave the team in better hands, and he’d still be a Nets fan. It sounded like a guy who knew that, eventually, he’d probably be gone. When he talks about the core, he mentions everybody else and not himself.

As for **Ben Simmons**, you can’t count on him at all. I know all summer he was hyped up like **Don King** that he’s going to come back. Physically, he hasn’t been able to do it. When you talk of him as a former three-time All-Star, the keyword is “former.” You can’t view him like that right now because he can’t get on the court.

**Marks:** If Simmons was a free agent this offseason, he’d get the minimum because he’s not reliable. That’s just the reality of it. What team out there, unless you’re going to sign him and put an injury protection clause in there that protects every part of his body, what team would go out there? I thought he was pretty good in the games he played this year, but since 2020-21, he hasn’t played.

**Scotto:** He’s rebounded and passed the ball well. He’s been an above-average defender, not the All-Defensive Team player on defense. I saw the games. He didn’t drive to the rim in the half court. He doesn’t want to go to the foul line. You can’t have that at 6-foot-10. I don’t know if it’s a confidence thing or what it is, but when that’s not happening, that’s a problem.

The Nets also have to pay **Nic Claxton**. They’re making it seem like they’re preparing to pay him. Claxton told me [**he wants to re-sign in Brooklyn**](https://hoopshype.com/lists/nic-claxton-hopes-to-re-sign-with-brooklyn-i-love-it-here/) when we did our interview. I have him somewhere in the $20-25 million range.

**Marks:** He’s probably at what Poeltl got somewhere around four years, $80 million with Toronto. I like Claxton better than Poeltl. They’re just in a weird spot because Houston controls their draft picks for the next four years. Normally, you’d want to have your own pick, tear it down, build around Bridges, and go from there, but there’s no incentive to do that. On the other end, you do have all these expiring contracts and we talked about Dinwiddie, so who’s your point guard next year?

**Scotto:** I’ve got one more for you, Bobby, because he’s a hot topic, **Cam Thomas**. He’s one of the most polarizing players in the league. Before he got moved to the bench, he was the leading scorer for the Nets. He’s improved. He’s gotten to the rim more and drawn fouls. His shot selection improved, even though I won’t say it’s always the best. What are your thoughts on him and potential plans for him with the Nets?

**Marks:** I think he’s gotten better and gets to the free throw line a lot more than he did a year ago, and I think that’s a sign of a guy who’s not just relying on jumpers. You hear he’s an empty stats guy that can put up 29 points and you’ll lose consistently. Thomas for me is a sixth man right now, and could be a high-level sixth man. **Jordan Clarkson** was a sixth man for a long time and is really good. I think it’s going to be interesting. He’s extension-eligible this offseason because he’ll be going into year four. What do you do with him? I understand the fan base in Brooklyn because the fan base has prioritized him and he’s like one of their own children. When you get drafted by that organization and you develop with moments of really good play, it’s like he’s one of theirs and so is Claxton. Is Thomas fine with being a sixth man?

**Scotto:** Other guys around the league will tell me on a championship-caliber team, which is what every team aspires to be one day, Thomas could be a **Lou Williams** or **Jamal Crawford** type of guy.",35,69,2024-01-12,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1950apb/michael_scotto_and_bobby_marks_talk_about_the/
GoNets,3 Days Until Brooklyn Basketball. #3 Drazen Petrovic.,"Came into his own in his second season with the Nets but was sadly taken too soon.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Wiki: Dražen Petrovic (pronounced \[dra?en petro?it?\]; October 22, 1964 – June 7, 1993) was a Croatian professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he initially achieved success playing professional basketball in Europe in the 1980s, before joining the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1989.

&amp;#x200B;

A star on multiple stages, Petrovic earned two silver medals and one bronze in Olympic basketball, a gold and a bronze in the FIBA World Cup, a gold and a bronze in the FIBA EuroBasket, and two EuroLeague titles. He represented Yugoslavia's national team and, later, Croatia's national team. He earned four Euroscars, and was named Mr. Europa twice. In 1985, he received the Golden Badge award for best athlete of Yugoslavia.\[1\]

&amp;#x200B;

Seeking a bigger arena after his career start in Europe, Petrovic joined the NBA in 1989, as a member of the Portland Trail Blazers. After playing mostly off the bench that year, Petrovic experienced a breakthrough following a trade to the New Jersey Nets. While starting for the Nets, he became one of the league's best shooting guards. Petrovic's career and life were cut short after he died in a car accident at the age of 28.\[2\]

&amp;#x200B;

Petrovic is considered the crucial part of the vanguard to the present-day mass influx of European players into the NBA.\[3\] Petrovic's #3 was retired by the Nets in 1993, and in 2002, he was posthumously enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\[4\] In 2013, he was voted the best European Basketball player in history, by players at the 2013 FIBA EuroBasket.

&amp;#x200B;

Born in Šibenik, SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia, Dražen Petrovic was the second child of Jovan ""Jole"", a police officer, and Biserka (née Mikulandra), a librarian.\[3\] His father, of Serb ethnicity, was born in Zagora, near Trebinje in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\[6\]\[7\]\[8\] His mother was born in Bilice, near Šibenik, and was from a traditional conservative Croat family, devoutly Roman Catholic.\[9\] The couple's eldest child, Aleksandar, would be the first one to tread the basketball path, providing a lead for his younger sibling. The Petrovic siblings are second cousins to the Serbian basketball player Dejan Bodiroga.

&amp;#x200B;

At the age of thirteen, Petrovic started playing in the youth selections of the local club Šibenka; at the age of fifteen he had already made the first team, just as Šibenka earned a place in the Yugoslav national first division. With young Petrovic as the star of the team, Šibenka reached the final of the FIBA Radivoj Korac Cup twice (1981–82 and 1982–83), losing to Limoges CSP both times. In 1983, the 18 year-old Petrovic hit two free throws for Šibenka's victory over Bosna in the final playoff game of the Yugoslavian club championship, but the title was taken away from Šibenka the next day by the national basketball federation with irregularities in refereeing cited as the reason, and awarded to Bosna after Šibenka refused to show up for the repeat match.

&amp;#x200B;

After spending a year serving the mandatory time in the military, Petrovic followed his brother's footsteps and moved to Cibona to form, at that time, the best backcourt duo in Europe. The very first year in Cibona he won both the Yugoslav League championship and the Yugoslav National Cup. To top it all off, the 87–78 victory over the Spanish League club Real Madrid, to which Petrovic contributed with 36 points, brought him and Cibona their first European Cup title. The second came the following year, as Petrovic scored 22 points and Cibona defeated the USSR Premier League club Žalgiris Kaunas, which starred the legendary Arvydas Sabonis. The same year brought another Yugoslav national cup title for Cibona, seeing Petrovic score 46 against the old rival Bosna. In 1987, Petrovic earned his third European trophy: a 2nd-tier European Cup Winners' Cup title against the Italian League club Scavolini Pesaro, whose net he filled with 28 points.\[14\]

&amp;#x200B;

Petrovic's scoring average during the four years with Cibona stood at 37.7 points in the Yugoslavian first division and 33.8 in all of the European wide competitions that he played in, with personal one-time bests of 112 (40/60 FG, 10/20 3Pts, 22/22 FT) in the Yugoslavian League, and 62 points in the 3rd-tier European league, the Korac Cup, respectively.\[15\] His scoring sheet was often known to show 40, 50, even 60 in a single game; in a 1985–86 season European League game against Limoges, Petrovic scored ten 3-pointers, including seven in a row during a first half stretch, for a final tally of 51 points and 10 assists;\[16\] the same season he scored 45 points and dished out 25 assists against the reigning Italian League champions Simac Milano.\[17\]\[18\]

&amp;#x200B;

Petrovic needed new challenges, which Cibona and the Yugoslavian League could not offer. Across the Atlantic, the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA had already used their third round pick on young Petrovic in 1986. However, he decided to postpone his departure to the United States. In 1988, he signed with Real Madrid instead, for at that time a hefty sum of around US$4 million.\[19\] The transfer wasn't without controversy as the Yugoslav sporting laws stipulated that players weren't allowed to professionally move abroad until reaching 28 years of age, while Petrovic was still only 23 when he signed with the famous Madrid club. In 2014, José Antonio Arízaga, the sports agent who played a key role in Petrovic's summer 1988 transfer from Cibona to Real, recalled a few details from this transaction: ""I spoke to Mirko Novosel, Dražen's coach at Cibona, and he told me two things. One, every problem in Yugoslavia can be taken care of with the right amount of money, and two, if Dražen leaves, every other player under 28 will be leaving and it'll be chaos. So, you can imagine all the individuals I had to bribe and all the places where I had to pay up in order to circumvent this law"".

&amp;#x200B;

The 1988–89 season saw Petrovic wear the colors of the Spanish ACB League basketball club Real Madrid. Although the Spanish national championship barely escaped them, as they lost to FC Barcelona in the fifth and decisive game of the league's final series, Petrovic helped Real to win the Spanish King's Cup title over their Catalan rivals. Petrovic also led the club to victory in the 2nd-tier European Cup Winners' Cup final against the Italian League club Snaidero Caserta by tying his previous best scoring performance in European competitions (62 points).\[19\] His first season in the ACB was also his last, but he still holds ACB single performance bests in a final series game in points made (42) and three-pointers made (8).\[15\]

&amp;#x200B;

Motivated by the challenge and pressured by the Portland Trail Blazers, who had drafted him 60th overall back in 1986, Petrovic finally stood firm in the decision to try to establish himself in the NBA. He left Spain rather abruptly at the end of the season; the Blazers assisted in buying out his contract with Real (for as much as US$1.5 million)\[21\] and Petrovic joined the Blazers for the 1989–1990 season.

&amp;#x200B;

The Blazers valued Petrovic as a shooter, but were concerned that he might not possess the quickness to play guard or the foot speed to play defense. They brought him onto the team primarily as an outside threat to shoot three-pointers. In the Blazers' offensive scheme he was to set up behind the line, receive a passed ball and go directly up to release his shot. Petrovic was an aggressive, attacking player who was used to creating his shot and shots for his teammates. Taking the ball out of his hands and making him a static shooter was foreign to him. Making matters worse, the Blazers already had a full rotation of guards, with a starting backcourt of Clyde Drexler and Terry Porter, and with veteran Danny Young as a reserve. Consequently, the reigning La Gazzetta dello Sport Euroscar European Player of the Year saw limited playing time. He had difficulty being productive in the limited role the Blazers had for him. In his rookie year during the 1989–90 NBA season, he averaged 7.4 points in 12 minutes playing time per game.\[22\] The following season veteran guard Danny Ainge was added to the team, and Petrovic's playing time dropped further to 7 minutes a game.\[22\] In many statements made prior to arriving in Portland, Petrovic had said he saw a lack of playing time as the only possible obstacle to his success in the NBA.\[19\]\[23\] He was determined to be a success in basketball's highest arena. His lack of playing time during his second season in the league brought Petrovic's frustration to a climax: ""I have nothing to say to Adelman any more and vice versa. Eighteen months have passed by, too long. I have to leave to prove how much I am worth. Never in my life did I sit on the bench and I don’t intent to do that in Portland.""\[24\]

&amp;#x200B;

At his insistence, 38 games into the season (20 of which held no playing time for Petrovic), a three-way trade with the Denver Nuggets sent him to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for a first-round pick in the following draft and Walter Davis, who was sent from Denver to Portland.

&amp;#x200B;

On January 23, 1991, Petrovic became a member of the New Jersey Nets. He joined a team that had not reached the playoffs since 1986, but had rookie Derrick Coleman, the number one selection from the 1990 draft. He was immediately given a role on the floor, with 20.5 minutes per game. His scoring over the remaining 43 games increased to 12.6 points per game, one of the league's best points-per-minute ratios. The following year, he and Coleman were joined by Kenny Anderson, giving the team a third talented new addition. Petrovic was made a starter for the 1991–92 season, his first full season with the Nets. Petro, as the Americans had dubbed him, did not miss a single game. His determination, hard work and aggressive on court demeanor established him as a team leader. In 36.9 minutes on the floor he averaged 20.6 points. Petrovic led the Nets in field-goal shooting and free-throw shooting, and his field goal percentage of 51% placed him near the top of all NBA guards. More importantly, his success translated into success for the team. The Nets made the playoffs, recording 14 more wins than the previous year. The following season saw Petrovic increase his scoring average to 22.3 ppg, 11th best in the league. On December 6, he was named MVP of the Week.\[27\] For the second season in a row he shot 45% from the three-point arc. His field goal percentage of 52% was again near the top for all guards. American media honored him with a selection to the All-NBA Third Team. However, he did not receive an invitation to the 1993 All-Star game. Among the top 13 scorers in the NBA that season, he was the only one not invited.\[28\]\[29\]

&amp;#x200B;

In an interview on the Scoop B Radio Podcast, Petrovic's Nets teammate, Chucky Brown marveled at Petrovic's healing ability. Brown told Brandon Scoop B Robinson that he remembered Petrovic spraining his knee and was slated to miss two months. Petrovic rehabbed so hard that he ended up only missing two weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Petrovic's national team debut came at the age of 15, at the Under-18 Balkan Championship in Turkey, where the Yugoslavian junior team won the bronze. The young man regularly played for the Yugoslavian national team in the Balkan Championships, also winning gold with the junior team and silver with the senior team. He also brought back the silver from the 1982 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship in Bulgaria.

&amp;#x200B;

The 1984 Summer Olympics were Petrovic's first competition of a grand scale with the Yugoslav senior national team, and the bronze medal won in Los Angeles that summer became his first Olympic medal. Third place was also earned at the 1986 FIBA World Championship, remembered for the last minute thriller in the semi-final game against the Soviet Union. At the 1987 EuroBasket, Petrovic again returned with bronze, as Yugoslavia lost to the hosts and gold medalists Greece. The University Games, held in Zagreb in 1987, saw the Yugoslavian squad with Petrovic win the gold. In the 1988 Summer Olympics, Yugoslavia with Petrovic, earned 2nd place, as they lost once more to the Soviet powerhouse.\[14\]

&amp;#x200B;

An excellent club season with Real Madrid was topped by Petrovic's 1989 accomplishment with the Yugoslav national team: at the EuroBasket in Zagreb, the young Yugoslavian team went all the way, defeating Greece more than comfortably in the championship game. Petrovic was the tournament's second leading scorer and most valuable player. The very next year, the summer in between the two most frustrating seasons of his professional career, as he struggled for playing time with the Trail Blazers, Petrovic was again making history with the national team, as Yugoslavia became world champions, after beating the Soviet Union for the gold in Buenos Aires, at the 1990 FIBA World Championship.

&amp;#x200B;

The 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, marked the first summer Olympics featuring the independent Croatia, and Petrovic was the leader of the Croatian national basketball team at the Olympic basketball tournament. Losing only to the American Dream Team in group stage, a strong and inspired Croatian team emerged victorious from the Semifinals against the revamped Soviet team, thanks to clutch free throws executed by Petrovic, and faced off against the Americans for the gold. Urged on by Petrovic's competitiveness and confidence,\[3\] the Croatians fared well in the first ten minutes of the game, taking a 25–23 lead on a Franjo Arapovic dunk and the subsequent free throw.\[32\] As the game progressed, however, the now-legendary team composed of NBA stars proved too tough for Croatia: the Americans won 117–85, sending Petrovic, the game's leading scorer with 24 points, and his teammates, home with silver medals.\[3\]\[33\]

&amp;#x200B;

In the period during which Petrovic played for the Croatian national team (from 1992 to 1993), he appeared in 40 games and scored 1,002 points. His highest point tally came against Estonia, on 31 May 1993 (48 points).

&amp;#x200B;

In the summer of 1993, after his best NBA season and the Nets' first-round elimination by the Cleveland Cavaliers, Petrovic traveled to Berlin, where the Croatian national team was playing a qualification tournament for the 1993 EuroBasket. He was contemplating departure from the Nets, disappointed with tension between himself, and in his belief, envious teammates, as well as the fact that the Nets had not yet extended his contract. He told American reporters that the lack of recognition in the league had him also considering leaving the NBA completely and playing club basketball in Greece; there were at least two Greek clubs ready to offer Petrovic three-year contracts worth US$7.5 million net.\[26\] It was rumored that Petrovic verbally agreed on terms with Panathinaikos; these rumors gave rise to the story of PAO's owner, Pavlos Giannakopoulos, allegedly offering the Nets' star a signed contract with blank salary terms, which became a part of Petrovic's legend. Petrovic decided to skip the connection flight back to Zagreb and drive with his girlfriend back to Croatia.

&amp;#x200B;

Petrovic died in a traffic accident at approximately 17:20 on Monday, June 7, 1993, four and a half months before his 29th birthday. On the rain-drenched Autobahn 9, he was a passenger in a car that was cut off by a semi truck at Denkendorf, near Ingolstadt, in the German state of Bavaria. According to the report of the Ingolstadt police, that afternoon a truck broke through the Autobahn median; the truck driver was trying to avoid a collision with a personal vehicle in his own lane and lost control of the truck, crashing through the median barrier and finally coming to a stop blocking all three lanes of traffic in the opposite direction (Munich). Seconds later, the VW Golf carrying a sleeping Petrovic in the passenger seat crashed into the truck, killing him and leaving the driver, Klara Szalantzy, a Hungarian model and basketball player with whom Petrovic was romantically involved, and Hilal Edebal, a female Turkish basketball player, with grave injuries.\[26\]\[35\] It was established that visibility on the road was very poor and that Petrovic was not buckled with a seatbelt.\[3\]

&amp;#x200B;

Petrovic's tomb 45°50'22?N 15°59'00?E at Mirogoj Cemetery instantly became a sanctuary for his compatriots. The Cibona stadium was renamed the Dražen Petrovic Basketball Hall on October 4, 1993, and the city of Zagreb dedicated a square in his name, which was later followed by Šibenik and Vukovar, while Petrinja dedicated him a street. The Nets retired his number 3 jersey on November 11, 1993. After 1994, the MVP award at the McDonald's Championship had borne the name Dražen Petrovic Trophy, and the Croatian Olympic Committee's award for young athletes has borne his name since 2006. On April 29, 1995, a statue commemorating Petrovic's significance to the world of sports was erected in front of the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, thus making him only the second athlete to receive this honor. On July 9, 2001, having defeated Patrick Rafter to win the men's singles title at Wimbledon, Croatian tennis player Goran Ivaniševic dedicated the win to his late friend Petrovic;\[36\] Ivaniševic wore Petrovic's Nets jersey amidst the 100,000 strong crowd celebrating his victory in Split.\[3\] Petrovic was inducted posthumously into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2006, the 13th anniversary of Petrovic's death was marked with the opening of the Dražen Petrovic Memorial Center in Zagreb, dedicated to his life and achievements, with ten themed galleries of multimedia content outlining his entire career and a four meter high statue of Dražen in shooting position in front of it. Petrovic was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2007.\[37\]

&amp;#x200B;

The 2010 documentary, Once Brothers (part of the ESPN 30 for 30 series), portrays the achievements of the Yugoslavia national basketball team in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and how the Yugoslav Wars tore the team apart. It explores Petrovic's broken friendship with Serbian/Yugoslav player Vlade Divac. In 2011, a statue of him as a little boy sitting on a bench with a ball was unveiled in Šibenik, and his old room was renovated the way it looked when he was young, as a first part of opening a Memorial Center in his hometown. During the 2012 Three Point Shootout, New Jersey Nets guard Anthony Morrow wore Petrovic's jersey in the latter's honor. In 2015, Australian writer Todd Spehr released a 470-page biography on Petrovic, Dražen: The Remarkable Life &amp; Legacy of the Mozart of Basketball.\[citation needed\] On June 3, 2015. Croatian basketball journalists Marjan Crnogaj and Vlado Radicevic released a 487-page (462 footnote) unofficial biography \[38\] which global paperback edition (472 pages, 679 footnotes, 50 photos) was released on October 14, 2017.\[39\]

&amp;#x200B;

A museum named ""The Dražen Petrovic Memorial Center"" was founded in his honor, and constitutes a co-operative effort led by the Dražen Petrovic Foundation in conjunction with the Croatian government, the city of Zagreb and the Croatian Museum of Sports. The memorial center idea originated from Petrovic's parents, Biserka and Jole Petrovic, and was supported with the contributions of Croatian architects Andrija Rusan and Niksa Bilic. All of the articles presented in the center have been collected and categorized by the Croatian Museum of Sports. The organization and operations of the center have been provided by the Dražen Petrovic Foundation, which is led by Petrovic's family. The Center contains his No. 3 New Jersey Nets jersey and the watch that stopped when he died in a car crash. The center features 1,000 memorabilia items and a video of his basketball highlights.\[43\]

&amp;#x200B;

The official opening of the museum was held on June 7, 2006, while the official opening of the center to the public began at the end of December 2006. The square on which the center is operated upon has been renamed to Dražen Petrovic Square in his honor.\[44\] In 2013, former NBA MVP Derrick Rose visited the museum.

GoNets,Our Team Defense in 2020-21,"In ESPN's most recent win-loss forecast, Kevin Pelton predicted 38 wins for Brooklyn.  The most shocking forecast was the 26th place ranking in defensive rating.

The general hot take consensus on r/nba seems to be that Brooklyn will have a very good offense but a very bad defense, so this isn't coming out of left field.

I have a very different view.  I think Brooklyn will almost definitely have a Top 10 defense.  Here's why:

1) Let's start with the fact that **our defense was upper division last year, ranking 9th in defensive rating.**  The issue with our team was actually offense, with an offensive rating that ranked 22nd.  We are not building on a weak base.

2) **This was a team that was missing its three top players accounting for the majority of salary cap** for either the entire season (KD) or big chunks of the season (Irving and LeVert).  75% of this year's salary cap was out or hobbled for big chunks of last season, for a team that finished 9th in defensive rating.

3) **We are bringing back most of the core.** True, we are missing that guy who was probably the best defender on last year's squad in David Nwaba, but he only played 268 minutes so overall impact was minimal.  The most impactful loss might be Garrett Temple, who is a solid defender, but not elite.

4) **We are adding Durant.**  This will be the big variable.  If mostly healthy, he is a mobile near 7-footer that is very effective as a secondary paint defender alongside a primary big.  I was really happy with his mobility in the first pre-season game, he was blocking, disrupting passing lanes, taking charges, and using his length to impact shots in both the paint and mid-range.  Durant's defensive value is significant and is being woefully under-estimated by pundits.

5) **The impact of Kyrie Irving** \- the other oft-cited factor is the full-year impact of Irving, a ""terrible"" defender according to many.  First, I think a lot of this is just coming from people who just like to shit on Irving.   Second, while he's not a great defender, but he's not a terrible defender either.  He is quick, has very active hands and a ton of basketball IQ.  He isn't huge but at a solid 6'2"" he is not under-sized either.  He can contribute defensively if he's a) motivated and b) has energy/capacity.  

On the motivation factor, while Kyrie may not have been motivated in Boston, I am less concerned about that because he is clearly motivated to a) cement his legacy by adding another championship to his resume and b) doing it for his childhood team in the Nets.  It sucked for Boston fans that he may have not been motivated to go all out for that city, but I'm just not worried about that for Brooklyn.

6) **Defense is labor-intensive.**  NBA basketball players only have so much energy.  And often, guys who take on a heavy offensive load - like Irving in the past - are primarily focused on conserving their energy for the offensive.  This means giving less on the defensive end.

Because Brooklyn has so many weapons now, this takes the impetus off Irving to be the sole breadwinner.  This will allow him to expend more energy on the defensive end.  By the way, this concept applies to all the Brooklyn Nets, going down the line.  Caris Levert, in particular, is not going to be depended on for significant offense, so he can focus all of his energy on the defensive end.  He certainly has the tools to be a strong wing defender.  Same with Dinwiddie.

7) **We have strong defense where it matters.**  Defensive impact in the NBA tends to be highest the bigger you are.  Ideally, you want your strongest defenders (relative to their position) to be bigs and it is easier to hide mediocre defenders in your guards.

Brooklyn is better positioned in that its best defenders (again, relative to position) tend to be at the spots in the lineup were defense matters more.  Jarrett Allen is a very good defender, and he also plays at the position where it matters the most.  At age 22, and given his track record you can see him taking another step forward and becoming a truly elite defender.  He has become a very good rebounder, he can guard the pick and roll, his feet are quick enough where he can do a passable job defending perimeter players and most significantly he is one of the strongest paint defenders in the league.

DeAndre Jordan isn't the defender he used to be, but he is still a strong paint defender.

As mentioned earlier, the addition of Durant means that for 30 minutes of most games, we will have two near-7-footers patrolling the paint area.  I think our paint defense will be very strong this year.

On the flip side, our worst defenders (on a relative basis) tend to be at the positions where defense matters less.  This would be at the 1 and the 2 positions, with guys like Irving, Dinwiddie, Harris and Shamet.

8) **Versatility is key.**  We just have a lot more piece to work with this year.  This is again the effect of adding two superstars at the top of the pyramid, pushing everybody down and improving the team at every level from starters to role players.  We have so much more depth this year because we aren't carrying 75% of dead salary cap on our roster.

Adding a defensive specialist like Bruce Brown is key to this.  He is a strong on-ball guard and wing defender that can be deployed situationally.  Green is also another athletic wing that provides versatility to be able to be deployed from the 3 to the 5 depending on matchups and situationas.

Steve Nash seems much more willing than Kenny Atkinson to be creative and dynamic with lineups.  Part of this may be just having more tools to work with, but I think part of it is philosophical as well.

**Bottom line:** I think Brooklyn is going to over-perform on pre-season expectations.  While it may take a little time to gel, barring major injuries, I think by the time the playoffs comes along, we will have a #5-#7 ranked team defense.  Along with a #1-2 ranked offense, this will put is in a good position for a very deep playoffs run.

What do you think about Brooklyn's defense this coming year?",34,23,2020-12-17,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/kevv47/our_team_defense_in_202021/
GoNets,For Those Looking for Nets Podcasts,"Spent way too much time listening to Nets podcasts the past few years so wanted to give some recs for any fans looking for Nets pods to listen to.

* **The Backcourt:** New podcast hosted by Lucas Kaplan and Sarah Kustok. Extremely excited for this podcast. Lucas does a great job with Nets content and is very knowledgeable with the X's and O's. Sarah, we all know is amazing and the plan for this pod seems to be going deeper into the X's and O's and discussing more niche topics about the team.
* **Brooklyn Buzz:** Jac and Nick do a great job with game recaps, covering recent news/quotes, interesting stats and storylines around the team. Good listen after feeling hyped from a win or feeling empty from a loss. Leans a bit more on the homer side, but they are in tune with everything surrounding the team and I feel are a good representation of the fan base. Upbeat, more positive podcast with good energy.
* **Bleav in Nets:** Hosted by Erik Slater, one of the Nets beat reporters. Been impressed with this podcast so far, I think Erik does a great job and has great info on the team. Frequently has guests on the pod (Ian Eagle episode was great), so good for having a more detailed look at news/perspectives on the team.
* **Voice of the Nets with Chris Carrino:** Chris is the play-by-play announcer for Nets radio. He does a lot of interviews with players on the team and did a series of recaps with Lucas Kaplan and Tim Capstraw (Color commentator for Nets radio) for a lot of players on the team.
* **The Brooklyn:** Another relatively new podcast hosted by Anthony Puccio and Collin Helwig of Nets Daily. If you've followed the Nets for a while, you'll be familiar with Pooch. Have only listened to a couple episodes but seems promising knowing Pooch and his connection to the Nets.

Other Nets podcasts if you're interested:

* **Locked On Nets:** These guys can't be beat when it comes to the consistency and quantity of episodes they produce. I think they are in tune and knowledgeable about the team and do a good job covering recent topics/news. In my opinion, have very rational, unbiased opinions regarding the team and the players.
* **The Glue Guys:** Disappeared sometime last year but was one of the main Nets podcasts for a while. Wasn't my favorite as I felt they weren't as in tune with the team as you might think. I don't know if they will be making a comeback.

  
Shoutout to The Clear Out podcast by Matt Brooks. Miss when he was covering the Nets during the KD, Kyrie era. There are definitely more good Nets pods out there that I haven't taken the time to listen to, so I'm interested to know any new recs as well.",33,9,2024-11-02,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1gi840j/for_those_looking_for_nets_podcasts/

GoNets,[Analysis] Rodion Kurucs reaches a low point and DeAndre Jordan exerting more effort on defense,"**Kurucs hits a low point**

[In prior analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/dne0go/analysis_the_reason_to_why_caris_levert_was/), I’ve mentioned Kurucs propensity to pump fake on threes, drive, and end up turning the ball over or missing a shot. Yesterday verse the Pelicans, he did it multiple times, leading to turnovers and a missed shot. Because of this, it got to the point where he was unplayable and Atkinson benched him for the entire second half. He’s struggling badly and while a lot of it is self-inflicted with the non-shooting, a very small portion of it isn’t. 

Last season, three aspects made up majority of Kurucs offense: [Spot-up shooting](https://i.imgur.com/g5zh9uN.png), [Cutting](https://i.imgur.com/L9Me3W7.png), and [Transition](https://i.imgur.com/Ww6x58s.png). But I want to look mostly at the cutting aspect of the offense, because it is non-existent this season. Regarding his offense coming from cuts, I think he misses D’angelo Russell, who he received the most passes and scored the most off the passes. When you watch Kurucs' highlights last season, he had good synergy with Russell for off-ball cuts.

For example:  
[D'angelo drives to the rim and hits Kurucs on a back cut for a dunk](https://streamable.com/2q9n4)

[D'Lo drives to the rim after a JA screen and hits Kurucs back door](https://streamable.com/9g4k1)

[Another D'Lo / JA high P&amp;R that leads to a back cut score by Kurucs](https://streamable.com/6xhzi)

[Here's a twitter thread involving more examples, most of them including Kurucs.](https://twitter.com/HalfCourtHoops/status/1153794109838020608)

This season, this hasn’t been happening for Kurucs. It took the DET game on Saturday for him to finally (I believe) register a basket off a cut and it was from Dinwiddie in the second quarter. To me, this a lack of chemistry with all the guards. Kyrie is new, Caris had a pass frequency to Kurucs of only 3.1% last season, and Dinwiddie isn’t exactly pass first (though he had the second highest pass frequency to Kurucs in 2018). 

Regardless if these back door cuts are available to him or not, he needs to take these wide open threes. However, since he's not, he's going to be dead weight on offense. He's actively taking out the main component of his offensive production and it's hurting him and the team.

**DeAndre Jordan being more active on defense** 

[I've also mentioned previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/dof7we/analysis_contextualizing_the_nets_passing/) that DJ should be more active on defense by putting a hand up if he isn't going to jump to contest shots. In the last two games, while he hasn't been perfect, he's has been giving more effort defensively.

[DJ gets the block from behind on Jrue Holiday when the Pelicans were pushing in transition](https://streamable.com/6zld4)

[Pistons run HORNs with Bruce Brown as the ball handler. He goes to the rim, DJ goes vertical, and forces the miss. ](https://streamable.com/e3pb2)

Some of these might be the result of playing against teams with centers that don't space the court and/or playing teams with poor spacing (DET), but wasn't exerting the effort he has recently. Not to imply he's perfect, he still has instances were he's not putting up his hand on shot attempts or not jumping, but it feels like it's reduced the last two games. It's a good sign going forward, but it sucks he got hurt. 

**Other opinions**

Me, like a lot of Nets fans, were excited about this season with the new additions to the roster. With the new additions, there was an idea coming into the season that the Nets bench this season would be better than last years. In theory, it makes sense. 

* DeAndre Jordan can fill Ed Davis’s role easily as a P&amp;R center and excellent rebounder.
* David Nwaba is Treveon Graham 2.0 (which is both good and problematic).
* Dinwiddie was a 6MOTY candidate last year, no reason he shouldn’t be this year.
* Garrett Temple can fill in DeMarre Carroll’s and Jared Dudley’s role as a veteran presence on and off the court. 
* Kurucs would make incremental improvement regardless if he started of was on the bench. 

Well, we've been wrong so far. this team's bench has been horrendous to start the season. The team went from a 10 man rotation on opening day to basically an 8 man rotation yesterday to finish the game. Dinwiddie is playing like he belongs in the g-league again (please play better soon), DJ just got hurt, Kurucs won't shoot jumpers, Temple is Temple, and Nwaba has been benched for three games now. The bench has been so bad that you can honestly make the case that the center coming off the bench has been their best bench player. If Dinwiddie starts playing like or close to his last season version, this problem might go away for the regular season, but there are still issues that will exist going forward, especially offensively. 

With DeAndre Jordan most likely out for an extended period with the ankle sprain (granted, no word yet), we might be able to see Claxton play on the road trip. He'll give the Nets a different dynamic with him at center if he's forced to switch out onto guards, but I still wouldn't expect much. He's still incredibly skinny compared to the rest of the NBA, so he'll get bounced around in the paint with ease. And he hasn't really played against NBA competition. That being said, having him play back up minutes against Portland isn't the worst thing if he has to play. The only real center they have right now is Whiteside and you can just match his minutes with JA. 

Prediction for the road trip: My gut feeling says 3-2, but it could also be 2-3. I think Portland is a good match up for the Nets. The Nets have played them well the last two seasons, but Dame and CJ can go off at any time, especially vs. the Nets horrible defense. And they'll be playing the Nets on a B2B. I wouldn't expect them to win @ UTA because they've generally sucked there the last few seasons. And I think they can pick up at least two games between the hot Phoenix Suns / Struggling Denver Nuggets / Struggling Chicago Bulls.",32,6,2019-11-05,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/ds6iii/analysis_rodion_kurucs_reaches_a_low_point_and/
GoNets,"Since the Pistons loss on Feb 10th, the Nets have the 6th best 2nd Half Defensive Rating in the league","I know that sounds like a cherrypicked stat, but a lot of us are aware that ever since that Pistons loss (I believe that's the one where Harden and DJ were arguing/discussing tactics after or at the end of the game), our defence has looked better. 

For the season, our DRtg is 113.3 (22nd in the league) and since that Pistons loss, our DRtg is 113.1 (21st in that span) so at face value it doesn't look there's much of a difference. For the season, our 1st Half DRtg is 112.1 (17th) and 2nd Half is 114.2 (27th). 

However, since that Pistons loss, our 1st Half DRtg is 116.3 (26th), but our 2nd Half DRtg is 110.1, which is the 6th best during that span. Our 4th quarter DRtg since the Pistons loss is 109.6, 11th best during that span. This is a sample of 43 games, so not that small. 

Before the Pistons loss, our 1st Half DRtg was 106.5 (6th, lol wtf), but our 2nd half was dead last at 120.8 (27 game sample).",31,9,2021-05-15,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/nctlwv/since_the_pistons_loss_on_feb_10th_the_nets_have/

GoNets,All I ask is to SHOW UP and play hard,"Literally this is all I ask for any player on the Nets. Just show up to play and play hard. If we are not talented enough or we miss shots I’m fine. I’m fine if a player makes mistakes on the court. No one is perfect.

But there are TWO THINGS every player in the NBA can control:

Show up

Play hard

If a player isn’t willing to do one of those things I’m done with him. He is dead to me. There is ZERO EXCUSE for not doing those things

For FOUR YEARS Kyrie hasn’t showed up to play. Constantly. Every year. 

When he missed games because of the Capitol Riots I made my position clear: TRADE HIS ASS. I don’t care how talented you are. If you don’t give the team a high priority, I don’t want you here. People here said I was crazy for wanting to get rid of him then. And every year since then Kyrie has proven me right.

I will be SO HAPPY to see Kyrie finally gone from this team. Crazy Cancer Kyrie. I can finally cheer for a team that I know has 13 guys who are bought in. 13 guys who will SHOW UP and PLAY HARD. 

I can deal with losing games. I can deal with losing in the playoffs. I cannot deal with a player who doesn’t have the decency to show up. 

Kyrie talks about being a leader. Bullshit. Leaders show up. During good times and especially bad times.

Kyrie calls his teammates his brothers. Bullshit. A brother doesn’t abandon you when they need you the most.

Kyrie says he loves the fans. Bullshit. You love money. You love pushing your own agenda. You love holding yourself out as some type of deep thinker. The truth is you are just a selfish prick.

Good riddance kyrie. And I hope you keep being a shithead wherever you go.",30,14,2023-02-05,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/10u0aol/all_i_ask_is_to_show_up_and_play_hard/
wnba,The New York Liberty’s Season Opener Added Another Win for the City (Gift Article),"NY Times takes the society/style temperature at the NY Liberty opener at Barclays. Pretty good non-sportswriter description of the celebrity row goings on at the Crown Club (VIP part of the club), plus regular WNBA fans. 

Of course Ellie is the biggest star. Loved Spike Lee for delaying his flight to Cannes to see the banner raised and rings given. I remember having a conversation with Spike in 2005 about the Liberty and if they were EVER gonna win a championship. 

Love Natasha Cloud even more for being nervous after the Knicks won the night before...she wanted a win on opening day so bad! I'm glad the Liberty put on a show and for me, seeing Ace's A'ja Wilson live with a showstopper performance was the icing on the cake.",30,0,2025-05-19,https://reddit.com/r/wnba/comments/1kq3g76/the_new_york_libertys_season_opener_added_another/
wnba,Off-White partners with WNBA’s New York Liberty: Why it matters,"It’s game on for Off-White. The Milan-based brand has seized the WNBA’s newfound fashion star, cementing its own US play with a New York Liberty partnership.

Off-White and New York Liberty are embarking on a multi-year deal under which Off-White will serve as the team’s “official style and culture curator”, the brands announced Friday. It’s Off-White’s first ever US sports team partnership. (The brand is now in the third year of its partnership with football team AC Milan, under which it’s created uniforms and for-sale capsule collections.)

The first product, a custom varsity jacket designed by Off-White creative director Ib Kamara, will debut on Sunday, 22 September, at the team’s first 2024 playoff game at Barclays Center. A limited number of these jackets will be available for fans to customise and pre-order at Barclays Center on Sunday, and during select future playoff games.

“Off-White is a catalyst force for change, creating platforms and giving voice to a community of young radicals, groundbreaking talents and unique cultural forces,” Off-White CEO Cristiano Fagnani said in a statement. “We are thrilled to partner with this inspiring team.”

Looking ahead, the brands will release fashion capsules each season, launch community programming initiatives and partner with Liberty players to celebrate tentpole moments including Women’s History Month, Black History Month and Pride.

The partnership is a major step for both parties, and the mutual benefits come at a key time for both Liberty and Off-White.

It's like getting an infected tooth pulled.  It's gonna suck but yeah, gotta suck it up and do it.  And I still have trouble getting over it's to the Knicks.  

I'm a Liberty STH, and I get the W is not for everyone but they do a great job of creating a fun atmosphere.  Why not bring the best mascot in the biz, Ellie the Elephant, to some Nets games and create some fun moments instead of looking at Ben Simmons' outfits.

GoNets,6 Days Until Brooklyn Basketball. #6 Kenyon Martin.,"&amp;#x200B;

Less than a week away and we're going to go with one of the heart and soul pieces of the Kidd Era teams, K-Mart! If only we could've found a way to keep him and add VC then we would no doubt be coming out of the East on a yearly basis. K-Mart ended up getting paid and sign and traded to Denver but ultimately knee injuries kept him from being the player that he was in NJ. Still he was a fan favorite and great energy guy that synced perfectly with Kidd's style of play.

&amp;#x200B;

Wiki: Martin was born in Saginaw, Michigan on December 30, 1977 to Lydia Moore, a single mother of two. He has a sister, Tamara, who is 3 1/2 years older. Shortly after, the family moved south to the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas, where she worked two jobs. Later, Kenyon was often watched by his sister while their mother worked.

&amp;#x200B;

He stuttered as a child, and attended three high schools in four years, but he sought refuge in sports, playing basketball, baseball, and football. In high school, many major universities showed interest in his basketball prowess, but the University of Cincinnati and assistant coach John Loyer recruited him hardest after seeing him play AAU ball after his junior year. He graduated from Bryan Adams High School in Dallas in 1996 (he was named to the school's hall of fame in 2009).

&amp;#x200B;

He went to the University of Cincinnati and played for the Cincinnati Bearcats under the direction of head coach Bob Huggins. He was homesick early in his freshman year and actually took a bus back to Dallas. But his mother as well as his older sister, who by then were working two jobs and attending college, steered him to return to school.

&amp;#x200B;

By the time he was a junior, he led Cincinnati to a 27-6 record and was named second-team All-Conference USA and, in the summer following, he led the U.S. team to the gold medal in the World University Games, leading the team in scoring and rebounding.

&amp;#x200B;

As a senior in 1999–2000, he averaged 18.9 points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.5 blocks per game during a season in which the Bearcats were ranked #1 for 12 weeks. That season, he recorded his second triple double with 28 points, 13 rebounds, and 10 blocks vs. Memphis (in 1997, he recorded 24/23/10 vs. DePaul). Martin was the consensus National Player of the Year, earning numerous awards from various organizations, and the team was ranked #1 in the nation at the conclusion of the regular season. However, Martin suffered a broken leg three minutes into the Bearcats' first game of the Conference USA Tournament, keeping him out of the NCAA Tournament that year. The team finished with a record of 29-4.

&amp;#x200B;

He remains the Bearcats' all-time leader in career blocked shots (292) and field goal percentage (.586). Cincinnati retired his #4 jersey on April 25, 2000. Later that year, Martin was selected first overall in the 2000 NBA draft by the New Jersey Nets. Martin is currently the last American-born college senior to have been the top overall pick.

&amp;#x200B;

Martin graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice.

&amp;#x200B;

As a rookie for the New Jersey Nets, Martin averaged 12 points, 7.4 rebounds and 1.7 blocks per game. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team and finished second in voting for NBA Rookie of the Year. In his second season, Martin averaged 14.9 points, 5.3 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 1.7 blocks per game in helping the Nets rise from last place in the Atlantic Division to an Eastern Conference title and the best season to date in the Nets' NBA history. Along with Jason Kidd, Kerry Kittles, Keith Van Horn and Richard Jefferson, Martin led the Nets to the 2002 NBA Finals, where they were swept by the Los Angeles Lakers. In his third season Martin again helped his team into the NBA finals, where the Nets lost in six games to the San Antonio Spurs. The next year, Martin averaged 16.7 points, 9.5 rebounds and 1.3 blocks en route to his first NBA All-Star selection, as a backup forward for the Eastern Conference All-Stars. In the 2004 NBA All-Star Game, Martin scored 17 points, grabbed 7 rebounds and had 3 assists.

&amp;#x200B;

Martin and teammate Alonzo Mourning almost fought when Martin mocked Mourning's life-threatening kidney disease. Martin later admitted that he had made a mistake and apologized to Mourning. On an episode of the Scoop B Radio Podcast, Martin told Brandon Scoop B Robinson that Mourning thought that Martin should have been working as hard as he was in morning shootarounds, but he was never a shootaround guy. Martin now participates in Mourning's annual charity basketball game (see below ""Off the court"").

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the 2003–04 season, Martin was traded to the Denver Nuggets for three future first-round draft picks in a sign-and-trade deal.

&amp;#x200B;

Martin played in 70 games during the 2004–05 season, averaging 15.5 points and 7.3 rebounds; however, a problem with his knee was detected shortly into the off-season, and on May 16, 2005, Kenyon underwent microfracture surgery on his left knee.

&amp;#x200B;

During the 2005–06 season, Martin missed 26 games due to knee tendinitis, but was able to return in time for the playoffs. During that playoff series against the Los Angeles Clippers, Martin was suspended from the Denver Nuggets indefinitely for ""conduct detrimental to the team.""During halftime of game two of the first round series, Martin got into an argument with head coach George Karl over his playing time, and refused to play for the second half of the game. During the offseason, Karl and Martin apparently ""patched things up.""

&amp;#x200B;

Believing injuries were behind him, Martin learned the swelling now occurring in his right knee would require another microfracture procedure. On November 15, 2006, after playing two regular season games, Martin underwent his second knee operation in less than two years. Martin is believed to be the first NBA player to have, and to return from, microfracture surgery on both knees.

&amp;#x200B;

Martin was fined $15,000 by the NBA when, during the third quarter of a 2006 game against the Chicago Bulls, Martin as well as some of his friends got into a verbal altercation with some fans. He was also cautioned to no longer bring his entourage to games.

&amp;#x200B;

To symbolize a fresh start to his career, Kenyon changed his uniform number from 6 to the number 4, which he wore in college, for the 2007–08 season.

&amp;#x200B;

Martin became an unrestricted free agent in the summer of 2011; however, due to the 2011 NBA lockout, he opted to sign a one-year contract with the Xinjiang Flying Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association. His contract reportedly would have made him the highest paid player in the Chinese league's history. On December 24, 2011, Martin was released from the club so that he could ""take care of family affairs"". Martin was initially not allowed to return to the NBA until the Flying Tigers' season ended on February 15, 2012, if not later due to the 2012 CBA Playoffs. However, the FIBA granted him an earlier release on February 2.

&amp;#x200B;

On February 3, 2012, Martin signed with the Los Angeles Clippers. In his first game with the Clippers, Martin scored 6 points and collected four rebounds in a loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.

&amp;#x200B;

On February 21, 2013, Martin agreed to join the New York Knicks on a 10-day contract, which reunited him with Jason Kidd. He officially joined the team on February 23. He was signed to a second 10-day contract on March 5, and signed for the remainder of the season on March 15. Upon his signing, he provided a large amount of help to a Knicks team that was depleted in the frontcourt, replacing Tyson Chandler, who was out with a neck injury, in the Knicks' starting lineup. On July 25, 2013, Martin re-signed with the Knicks for the 2013–14 season.

&amp;#x200B;

On January 9, 2015, Martin signed a 10-day contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. He made his Bucks debut later that night, recording 6 points, 2 rebounds and 1 block in the 98-84 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. He went on to sign a second 10-day contract with the Bucks on January 19, and for the rest of the 2014–15 season on January 29.

&amp;#x200B;

On February 19, 2015, Martin was waived by the Bucks.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 3, 2015, Martin announced his retirement from professional basketball.

&amp;#x200B;

Martin is the half-brother of former Colorado Buffaloes shooting guard Richard Roby. He is also the cousin of Robert ""50"" Martin of AND1 Mixtape Tour fame. 

&amp;#x200B;

Martin started The Kenyon Martin Foundation to provide for families in need, especially those without a father figure in their lives. According to the foundation's website, organizations receiving grants (many in the Denver and Dallas areas) include All for One and One for All, American Institute for Stuttering, Bryan Adams High School (his alma mater), Colorado HAWKS (Hard At Work Kids) to ""create an opportunity and an alternative to gangs for at-risk, disadvantaged youth"", The Children's Museum of Denver, Denver Rescue Mission, Ludacris Foundation Helping Youth Help Themselves initiative, SafeHaven of Tarrant County domestic violence shelter for women, The Salvation Army, The Bridge Project, Third Way Center ""providing mental health treatment in a residential setting for troubled teens"", and Warren Village that helps ""low-income single-parent families achieve sustainable personal and economic self-sufficiency."" The foundation also runs the Hoops for Kids Basketball camp.

&amp;#x200B;

He has been active in support of non-profit The Stuttering Foundation of America since 2005, and in 2008 he was a recipient of the Freeing Voices, Changing Lives Leadership Award from the American Institute for Stuttering, for which he serves on the board of directors. He has served as honorary Ambassador for the March of Dimes Colorado Chapter to raise awareness about premature birth. He plays in the annual The Summer Groove in Miami, a charity event benefitting Alonzo Mourning Charities and Dwyane Wade's World Foundation. He also supports Special Olympics.

&amp;#x200B;

Martin has also been involved in philanthropic activities including donating $1,000 for each point and blocked shot in two games for the Asian tsunami relief efforts, buying the occasional home game ticket for less financially fortunate fans, and participating in number of campaigns like ""Eat Right"" and ""Art of Sport.""

GoNets,45 Days Until Brooklyn Basketball. #45 Gerald Wallace.,"He started off as a fun energetic player in New Jersey but soon turned into a massive liability for Brooklyn just a season later. However today we look back at the Nets career of ""Crash"".

&amp;#x200B;

Wiki: Gerald Jermaine Wallace (born July 23, 1982) is an American retired professional basketball player. He played college basketball with Alabama.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace attended Childersburg High School in Childersburg, Alabama, where he had a very successful career. For his senior season efforts, he was named the Naismith Prep Player of the Year, an honor given to the best high school basketball player.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace attended the University of Alabama for one season before declaring himself eligible for the 2001 NBA draft. Wallace was drafted in the first round as the 25th overall pick. In 2000–01, he averaged 9.8 points and 6.0 rebounds per game.

&amp;#x200B;

In three seasons with the Sacramento Kings, Wallace rarely played, but in his brief appearances, he made himself known for his versatility and extraordinary athleticism. In the 2002 Slam Dunk Contest, Wallace finished second to two-time winner Jason Richardson. During his tenure with the Kings, Wallace was the odd man out in a deep roster that included All-Stars Chris Webber, Peja Stojakovic, Vlade Divac, Hedo Türkoglu and Brad Miller.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace was selected by the Charlotte Bobcats as part of the 2004 NBA Expansion Draft. He would start immediately for the club, and went on to have a season of averaging 11.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 1.3 blocks a game. He continued to improve in 2005–06, before getting injured in January, averaging 14.5 points and 7 rebounds, and ranking in the top 10 in the NBA in field goal percentage (54.142), blocks (2.19), and steals per game (2.44). Since the NBA began counting blocks as a statistic in 1973, only two other players (David Robinson and Hakeem Olajuwon) in league history have averaged over 2.0 blocks and 2.0 steals per game in a single season.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace was known for his somewhat reckless style of play that led to his frequent injuries and earned him the nickname ""Crash"". He missed a total of 39 games in his first two years with the Bobcats, but his energetic and sometimes dangerous behavior that may have caused his injuries was also what contributed to his gaudy defensive stats. Coach Bernie Bickerstaff said of Wallace ""Gerald can only play one way and be effective. Energy -- that's his game."" In 2006, Wallace attempted to refine his game in order to avoid being injured, and as a result his numbers suffered. The first month of the season, Wallace had only five total blocks (an average of .3 per game) and his averages were down across the stat line from 2005. Wallace improved his play in the second month of the season, but he went down with a separated shoulder in a December game against the Indiana Pacers. When he returned, Wallace continued his fine play finishing the season averaging 18.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2 steals, and 1 block in 72 games.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace appeared opposite Tim Duncan in the March 2008 ""SLAM-UP"" centerfold for SLAM Magazine.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace continued his fine play finishing the season averaging 18.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2 steals, and 1 block in 72 games.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace appeared opposite Tim Duncan in the March 2008 ""SLAM-UP"" centerfold for SLAM Magazine.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace suffered a Grade 3 concussion on February 23, 2008 after taking an unintentional elbow to the face from Sacramento's Mikki Moore. It was his fourth concussion in as many seasons with the Bobcats. It was not clear when he would return, although Grade 3 concussions are defined by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons as ones that ""involve post-traumatic amnesia for more than 24 hours or unconsciousness for more than five minutes. Players who sustain this grade of brain injury should be sidelined for at least one month, after which they can return to play if they are asymptomatic for one week."" He returned later on in the season, finishing the year with a new career high in points, assists, and minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

He suffered a partially collapsed lung and a fractured rib after being flagrantly fouled while driving for a layup by Los Angeles Lakers' Andrew Bynum on January 27, 2009 and was forced to miss seven games. He also was unable to fly and instead crossed the United States en route back to Charlotte by bus.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace was selected to play in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game in Dallas, becoming the first and only Charlotte Bobcat to do so (with the Bobcats changing their name back to their original Hornets name after reclaiming the Charlotte NBA history originally owned by the Pelicans franchise in 2014). Wallace was also selected to participate in the 2010 NBA All-Star Weekend Slam Dunk Contest. He was also selected to the 2010–2012 USA Basketball Men's National Team to represent the United States in the 2010 FIBA World Championship along with a possible trip with the team to the 2012 Olympics.

&amp;#x200B;

In the first-ever playoff game for the Bobcats, Wallace led the team with 25 points. This franchise playoff single game scoring record lasted until game 2 of the series, when Stephen Jackson broke the record by scoring 27 points.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2010, Wallace was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team. During the 2010–2011 season as a Bobcat, he averaged 15.6 points per game, 8.2 rebounds per game, and 2.4 assists per game in 39 minutes per game. He played 48 games with the team during the season.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace is one of three players in NBA history (the others being David Robinson and Hakeem Olajuwon) to average at least two steals and two blocks per game over the course of an entire season.

&amp;#x200B;

On February 24, 2011, Wallace was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for Joel Przybilla, Dante Cunningham, Sean Marks, and two future draft picks. He provided help for the team while Brandon Roy was injured. The Trail Blazers finished 48-34, good for the playoffs. They lost in the opening round to the Dallas Mavericks in 6 games. In the next season as a Trail Blazer, Wallace averaged 13.3 points per game, 6.6 rebounds per game, and 2.7 assists per game in 35.8 minutes per game. He played 42 games with the team that season.

&amp;#x200B;

On March 15, 2012, Wallace was traded from the Portland Trail Blazers to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for Shawne Williams, Mehmet Okur and a 2012 top-3 protected 1st round draft pick. On April 8, 2012, Wallace injured his left leg on a put back dunk. Wallace would only play 2 more games the entire season. Wallace played in 16 total games for the Nets that season and averaged 15.2 points per game. On July 11, 2012, Wallace re-signed with the Nets. The contract is reportedly worth $40 million for four years. In the first game of the season Wallace injured his left ankle. With just 27 seconds left on the game clock, Wallace got hurt trying to block a shot by Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry. After the game the team announced it was a sprained left ankle. Wallace would miss 6 games before making his return. Wallace would get injured again when the Nets played the Phoenix Suns on January 11, 2013. Wallace injured his ribs after the Phoenix Suns player P. J. Tucker fouled him hard while attempting a fast break dunk early in the first quarter. Wallace landed awkwardly on the floor and remained on the court for several moments before being helped to get on his feet and to the locker room. He did not return to the game. Wallace would miss 2 games until he returned to play the Atlanta Hawks.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace was traded to the Boston Celtics on July 12, 2013, in a multi-player deal that sent Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Jason Terry to the Nets.

&amp;#x200B;

On February 28, 2014, Wallace was ruled out for the rest of the season after an MRI revealed a torn meniscus in his left knee.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 27, 2015, Wallace was traded, along with Chris Babb, to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for David Lee. Four days later, Wallace was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, along with cash and draft considerations, in exchange for Jason Thompson. On September 27, 2015, he was waived by the 76ers.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace is represented by agent Rob Pelinka.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace started The Gerald Wallace Foundation to provide opportunities for underserved children and their families in his hometown of Childersburg, Alabama, and his former playing city of Portland, Oregon.

&amp;#x200B;

Wiki: Julius Winfield Erving II (born February 22, 1950), commonly known by the nickname Dr. J, is an American retired basketball player who helped popularize a modern style of play that emphasizes leaping and playing above the rim. Erving helped legitimize the American Basketball Association (ABA) and was the best-known player in that league when it merged with the National Basketball Association (NBA) after the 1975–76 season. He is now a coach of Tri-State of the BIG3.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving won three championships, four Most Valuable Player Awards, and three scoring titles with the ABA's Virginia Squires and New York Nets (now the NBA's Brooklyn Nets) and the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers. He is the eighth-highest scorer in ABA/NBA history with 30,026 points (NBA and ABA combined). He was well known for slam dunking from the free throw line in slam dunk contests and was the only player voted Most Valuable Player in both the ABA and the NBA.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving was inducted in 1993 into the Basketball Hall of Fame and was also named to the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time team. In 1994, Erving was named by Sports Illustrated as one of the 40 most important athletes of all time. In 2004, he was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame.

&amp;#x200B;

Many consider him one of the most talented players in the history of the NBA; he is widely acknowledged as one of the game's best dunkers. While Connie Hawkins, ""Jumping"" Johnny Green, Elgin Baylor, Jim Pollard and Gus Johnson performed spectacular dunks before Erving's time, ""Dr. J"" brought the practice into the mainstream. His signature dunk was the ""slam"" dunk, since incorporated into the vernacular and basic skill set of the game in the same manner as the ""crossover"" dribble and the ""no look"" pass. Before Julius Erving, dunking was a practice most commonly used by the big men (usually standing close to the hoop) to show their brutal strength which was seen as style over substance, even unsportsmanlike, by many purists of the game. However, the way Erving utilized the dunk more as a high-percentage shot made at the end of maneuvers generally starting well away from the basket and not necessarily a ""show of force"" helped to make the shot an acceptable strategy, especially in trying to avoid a blocked shot. Although the slam dunk is still widely used as a show of power, a method of intimidation and a way to fire up a team (and spectators), Dr. J demonstrated that there can be great artistry and almost balletic style to slamming the ball into the hoop, particularly after a launch several feet from that target.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving was born in East Meadow, New York, and raised from the age of 13 in Roosevelt, New York. Prior to that, he lived in nearby Hempstead. He played for Roosevelt High School and received the nickname ""Doctor"" or ""Dr. J"" from a high school friend named Leon Saunders. He explains,

&amp;#x200B;

I have a buddy—his name is Leon Saunders—and he lives in Atlanta, and I started calling him ""the professor"", and he started calling me ""the doctor"". So it was just between us...we were buddies, we had our nicknames and we would roll with the nicknames. Lo and behold we graduate from high school together, we both go to U-Mass, and we separated for many years 'cause he went over to Africa and did some stuff, and I went my way. But now he's my golf buddy in Atlanta...and I love him. He's just like a little brother to me even though, you know, there's only months between us. But he's the professor and he was the first one to call me ""the doctor"". And that's where it came from.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving recalled, ""Later on, in the Rucker Park league in Harlem, when people started calling me 'Black Moses' and 'Houdini', I told them if they wanted to call me anything, call me 'Doctor,'"" Over time, the nickname evolved into ""Dr. Julius,"" and finally ""Dr. J.""

&amp;#x200B;

Erving enrolled at the University of Massachusetts in 1968. In two varsity college basketball seasons, he averaged 26.3 points and 20.2 rebounds per game, becoming one of only six players to average more than 20 points and 20 rebounds per game in NCAA Men's Basketball.

&amp;#x200B;

Having left college early to pursue a professional career, Erving earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst through the University Without Walls program in creative leadership and administration in 1986, fulfilling a promise he had made to his mother. Erving also holds an honorary doctorate from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

&amp;#x200B;

Although NBA rules at the time did not allow teams to draft players who were less than four years removed from high school, the ABA instituted a “hardship” rule that would allow players to leave college early. Erving took advantage of the rule change and left Massachusetts after his junior year to sign a four-year contract worth $500,000 spread over seven years with the Virginia Squires.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving quickly established himself as a force and gained a reputation for hard and ruthless dunking. He scored 27.3 points per game as a rookie, was selected to the All-ABA Second Team, made the ABA All-Rookie Team, led the ABA in offensive rebounds, and finished second to Artis Gilmore for the ABA Rookie of the Year Award. He led the Squires into the Eastern Division Finals, where they lost to the Rick Barry-led New York Nets in seven games. The Nets would eventually go to the finals, losing to the star-studded Indiana Pacers team.

&amp;#x200B;

Under NBA rules, he became eligible for the 1972 NBA draft and the Milwaukee Bucks picked him in the first round (12th overall). This move would have brought him together with Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. However prior to the draft, he signed a contract with the Atlanta Hawks worth more than $1 million with a $250,000 bonus. The signing with the Hawks came after a dispute with the Squires where he demanded a renegotiation of the terms. He discovered that his agent at the time, Steve Arnold, was employed by the Squires and convinced him to sign a below-market contract.

&amp;#x200B;

This created a dispute between three teams in two leagues. The Bucks asserted their rights to Erving via the draft, while the Squires went to court to force him to honor his contract. He joined Pete Maravich at the Hawks' training camp, as they prepared for the upcoming season. He played two exhibition games with the Hawks until J. Walter Kennedy ruled that the Bucks owned Erving’s rights via the draft. Kennedy fined the Hawks $25,000 per game in violation of his ruling. Atlanta appealed Kennedy’s decision to the league owners, who also supported the Bucks’ position. While waiting for the owners’ decision, Erving played in one more preseason game, earning the Hawks another fine. Erving enjoyed his brief time with Atlanta, and he would later duplicate with George Gervin his after-practice playing with Maravich.

&amp;#x200B;

On October 2, Judge Edward Neaher issued an injunction that prohibited him from playing for any team other than the Squires. The judge then sent the case to arbitrator because of an arbitration clause in his contract with Virginia. He agreed to report to the Squires while his appeal of the injunction made its way through the court.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in the ABA, his game flourished, and he achieved a career-best 31.9 points per game in the 1972–1973 season. The following year, the cash-strapped Squires sold his contract to the New York Nets.

&amp;#x200B;

The Squires, like most ABA teams, were on rather shaky financial ground. The cash-strapped team sent Erving to the Nets in a complex deal that kept him in the ABA. Erving signed an eight-year deal worth a reported $350,000 per year. The Squires received $750,000, George Carter, and the rights to Kermit Washington for Erving and Willie Sojourner. The Nets also sent $425,000 to the Hawks to reimburse the team for its legal fees, fines and the bonus paid to Erving. Finally, Atlanta would receive draft compensation should a merger of the league result in a common draft.

&amp;#x200B;

He went on to lead the Nets to their first ABA title in 1973–74, defeating the Utah Stars. Erving established himself as the most important player in the ABA. His spectacular play established the Nets as one of the better teams in the ABA, and brought fans and credibility to the league. The end of the 1975–76 ABA season finally brought the ABA–NBA merger. The Nets and Nuggets had applied for admission to the NBA before the season, in anticipation of the eventual merger that had first been proposed by the two leagues in 1970 but which was delayed for various reasons, including the Oscar Robertson suit. The Erving-led Nets defeated the Denver Nuggets in the swan-song finals of the ABA. In the postseason, Erving averaged 34.7 points and was named Most Valuable Player of the playoffs. That season, he finished in the top 10 in the ABA in points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, steals per game, blocks per game, free throw percentage, free throws made, free throws attempted, three-point field goal percentage and three-point field goals made.

&amp;#x200B;

The Nets, Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs joined the NBA for the 1976–77 season. With Erving and Nate Archibald (acquired in a trade with Kansas City), the Nets were poised to pick up right where they left off. However, the New York Knicks upset the Nets' plans when they demanded that the Nets pay them $4.8 million for ""invading"" the Knicks' NBA territory. Coming on the heels of the fees the Nets had to pay for joining the NBA, owner Roy Boe reneged on a promise to raise Erving's salary. Erving refused to play under these conditions and held out in training camp.

&amp;#x200B;

After several teams such as the Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers lobbied to obtain him, the Nets offered Erving's contract to the New York Knicks in return for waiving the indemnity, but the Knicks turned it down. This was considered one of the worst decisions in franchise history. The Sixers then decided to offer to buy Erving's contract for $3 million—roughly the same amount as the Nets' expansion fee—and Boe had little choice but to accept. This would total $6 million overall, with the other half going to Erving. His new jersey number 6 would derive from the $6 million paid by the Philadelphia 76ers; it also matched the team nickname ""Sixers"". For all intents and purposes, the Nets traded their franchise player for a berth in the NBA. The Erving deal left the Nets in ruin; they promptly crashed to a 22–60 record, the worst in the league.Years later, Boe regretted having to trade Erving, saying, ""The merger agreement killed the Nets as an NBA franchise . . . . The merger agreement got us into the NBA, but it forced me to destroy the team by selling Erving to pay the bill.""

&amp;#x200B;

Erving quickly became the leader of his new club and led them to an exciting 50-win season. However, playing with bigger stars forced his role to diminish. In the ABA, he would be told to do everything for his team. With the Sixers, he focused more on scoring. Despite a smaller role, Erving stayed unselfish. The Sixers, featuring other stars like ABA co-MVP George McGinnis, ABA All-Star Caldwell Jones, future All-Star World B Free (then Lloyd Free), outside shooting threat Henry Bibby (father of Mike Bibby), and the versatile and aggressive Doug Collins (later Michael Jordan's coach during the late 1980s), won the Atlantic Division and were the top drawing team in the NBA. The Sixers defeated the defending champions, the Boston Celtics, to win the Eastern Conference. Erving took them into the NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers of Bill Walton. After the Sixers took a 2–0 lead, however, the Blazers defeated them with four straight victories after the famous brawl between Maurice Lucas and Darryl Dawkins which ignited the Blazers' chemistry.

&amp;#x200B;

However, Dr. J enjoyed success off the court, becoming one of the first basketball players to endorse many products and to have a shoe marketed under his name. It was at this time that he appeared in television commercials urging young fans asking for his autograph in an airport to refer to him henceforth as ""Dr. Chapstick"". He also starred in the 1979 basketball comedy film, The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh. A famous TV commercial for Sixers season tickets during the 1977–78 off-season summed up Erving's desire to win an NBA Title. In the commercial, Erving was in the Sixers locker room and he said to fans, ""We owe you one"" while he held up his index finger. It took a few years for the Sixers franchise to build around Erving. Eventually coach Billy Cunningham and top-level players like Maurice Cheeks, Andrew Toney, and Bobby Jones were added to the mix and the franchise was very successful.

&amp;#x200B;

In the following years, Erving coped with a team that was not yet playing at his level. The Sixers were eliminated twice in the Eastern Conference Finals. In 1979, Larry Bird entered the league, reviving the Boston Celtics and the storied Celtics–76ers rivalry; these two teams faced each other in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1985. The Bird vs. Dr. J matchup became arguably the top personal rivalry in the sport (along with Bird vs. Magic Johnson), inspiring the early Electronic Arts video game One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1980, the 76ers prevailed over the Celtics to advance to the NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. There, Erving executed the legendary ""Baseline Move"", a behind-the-board reverse layup. However, the Lakers won 4–2 with superb play from, among others, Magic Johnson.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving again was among the league's best players in the 1980–1981 and 1981–1982 seasons, although more disappointment came as the Sixers stumbled twice in the playoffs: in 1981, the Celtics eliminated them in 7 games in the 1981 Eastern Finals after Philadelphia had a 3–1 series lead, but lost both Game 5 and Game 6 by 2 points and the deciding Game 7 by 1) and in 1982, the Sixers managed to beat the defending champion Celtics in 7 games in the 1982 Eastern Finals but lost the NBA Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers in 6 games. Despite these defeats, Erving was named the NBA MVP in 1981 and was again voted to the 1982 All-NBA First Team.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, for the 1982–83 season, the Sixers obtained the missing element to combat their weakness at their center position, Moses Malone. Armed with one of the most formidable and unstoppable center-forward combinations of all time, the Sixers dominated the whole season, prompting Malone to make the famous playoff prediction of ""fo-fo-fo (four-four-four)"" in anticipation of the 76ers sweeping the three rounds of the playoffs en route to an NBA title. In fact, the Sixers went four-five-four, losing one game to the Milwaukee Bucks in the conference finals, then sweeping the Lakers to win the NBA title.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving maintained his all-star caliber of play into his twilight years, averaging 22.4, 20.0, 18.1, and 16.8 points per game in his final seasons. In 1986, he announced that he would retire after the season, causing every game he played to be sold out with adoring fans. That final season saw opposing teams pay tribute to Erving in the last game Erving would play in their arenas, including in cities such as Boston and Los Angeles, his perennial rivals in the playoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving retired in 1987 at the age of 37. ""A young Julius Erving was like Thomas Edison, he was always inventing something new every night"", Johnny Kerr told ABA historian Terry Pluto. He is also one of the few players in modern basketball to have his number retired by two franchises: the Brooklyn Nets (formerly the New York Nets and New Jersey Nets) have retired his No. 32 jersey, and the Philadelphia 76ers his No. 6 jersey. He was an excellent all around player who was also an underrated defender. In his ABA days, he would guard the best forward, whether small forward or power forward, for over 40 minutes a game, and simultaneously be the best passer, ball handler, and clutch scorer every night. Many of Erving's acrobatic highlight feats and clutch moments were unknown because of the ABA's scant television coverage. He is considered by many as the greatest dunker of all time.

&amp;#x200B;

In his ABA and NBA careers combined, he scored more than 30,000 points. In 1993, Erving was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. When he retired, Erving ranked in the top 5 in scoring (third), field goals made (third), field goals attempted (fifth) and steals (first). On the combined NBA/ABA scoring list, Erving ranked third with 30,026 points. As of 2018, Erving ranks eighth on the list, behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, Dirk Nowitzki, and LeBron James.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving in this memorable contest would face George ""The Iceman"" Gervin, All-Star and former teammate Larry ""Special K"" Kenon, MVP Artis ""The A-Train"" Gilmore, and David ""The Skywalker"" Thompson. Erving would start by dunking two balls in the hoop. Then, he would release a move that brought the slam dunk contest to the national consciousness. He would go all the way to the end of the court and run to release a free throw line dunk. Although dunking from the foul line had been done by other players (Jim Pollard and Wilt Chamberlain in the 1950s, for example), Erving introduced the dunk jumping off the foul line to a wide audience, when he demonstrated the feat in the 1976 ABA All-Star Game Dunking Contest.

&amp;#x200B;

This event transpired during game 6 of the 1977 NBA Finals. After Portland scored a basket, Erving immediately ran the length of the court with the entire Blazers team defending him. He performed a crossover to blow by multiple defenders and seemingly glided to the hoop with ease. With UCLA defensive legend Bill Walton waiting in the post, Erving threw down a vicious slam dunk over Walton's outstretched arms. This dunk is considered by many to be one of the strongest dunks ever attempted considering he ran full court with all five defenders running with him. This move was one of the highlights of his arrival to a more television-exposed NBA.

&amp;#x200B;

One of his most memorable plays occurred during the 1980 NBA Finals, when he executed a seemingly impossible finger-roll behind the backboard. He drove past Lakers forward Mark Landsberger on the right baseline and went in for a layup. Then 7'2? center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar crossed his way, blocking the route to the basket and forcing him outwards. In mid-air, it was apparent that Erving would land behind the backboard. But somehow he managed to reach over and score on a right-handed layup despite the fact that his whole body, including his left shoulder, was already behind the hoop. This move, along with his free-throw line dunk, has become one of the signature events of his career. It was called by Sports Illustrated, ""The, No Way, even for Dr J, Flying Reverse Lay-up"". Dr J called it ""just another move"".

&amp;#x200B;

Another of Erving's most memorable plays came in the final moments of a regular-season game against the Los Angeles Lakers in 1983. After Sixers point guard Maurice Cheeks deflected a pass by Lakers forward James Worthy, Erving picked up the ball and charged down the court's left side, with one defender to beat—the Lakers' top defender Michael Cooper. As he came inside of the 3-point line, he cupped the ball into his wrist and forearm, rocking the ball back and forth before taking off for what Lakers radio broadcaster Chick Hearn best described as a ""Rock The Baby"" slam dunk: he slung the ball around behind his head and dunked over a ducking Cooper. This dunk is generally regarded as one of the greatest dunks of all time.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving earned his bachelor's degree in 1986 through the University Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. After his basketball career ended, he became a businessman, obtaining ownership of a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Philadelphia and doing work as a television analyst. In 1997, he joined the front office of the Orlando Magic as Vice President of RDV Sports and Executive Vice President.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving and former NFL running back Joe Washington fielded a NASCAR Busch Series team from 1998 to 2000, becoming the first ever NASCAR racing team at any level owned completely by minorities. The team had secure sponsorship from Dr Pepper for most of its existence. Erving, a racing fan himself, stated that his foray into NASCAR was an attempt to raise interest in NASCAR among African-Americans.

&amp;#x200B;

He has also served on the Board of Directors of Converse (prior to their 2001 bankruptcy), Darden Restaurants, Inc., Saks Incorporated and The Sports Authority. As of 2009, Erving was the owner of The Celebrity Golf Club International outside of Atlanta, but the club was forced to file for bankruptcy soon after. He was ranked by ESPN as one of the greatest athletes of the 20th Century.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Erving is a Christian. Erving has spoken about his faith, saying, ""After searching for the meaning of life for over ten years, I found the meaning in Jesus Christ.""

&amp;#x200B;

Erving was first called ""Dr.J."" by his friend and teammate on the Nets and Squires, Willie Sojourner.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving was married to Turquoise Erving from 1972 until 2003. Together they had four children. In 2000, their 19-year-old son Cory went missing for weeks, until he was found drowned after driving his vehicle into a pond. Erving has called this the worst day of his life.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1979, Erving began an adulterous affair with sportswriter Samantha Stevenson, resulting in the 1980 birth of American tennis player Alexandra Stevenson. Although Erving's fatherhood of Alexandra Stevenson was known privately to the families involved, it did not become public knowledge until Stevenson reached the semifinals at Wimbledon in 1999, the first year she qualified to play in the tournament. Erving had provided financial support for Stevenson over the years, but had not otherwise been part of her life. The public disclosure of their relationship did not initially lead to contact between father and daughter. However, Stevenson contacted Erving in 2008 and they finally initiated a further relationship. In 2009 Erving attended the Family Circle Cup tennis tournament to see Stevenson play, marking the first time he had attended one of her matches.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2003, he fathered a second child outside of his marriage, Justin Kangas, this time with a woman named Dorýs Madden. Julius and Turquoise Erving were subsequently divorced. Erving continued his relationship with Madden, with whom he had Jules Erving and two others; they married in 2008. Erving has fathered nine children in total.

GoNets,"People seem to be having trouble with W/L points and how seeding in the Division and Conference work, So here is an explanation leading up to Jan 12th vs the Celtics. With help from u/swapan_99","This is a snippet from u/swapan_99 that made me want to write this up. I don't know how to do quotes. Depends on multiple things. If you have beaten the other team and have H2H record over them, that takes precedence. 

If you're tied in H2H, then your division standings get used. If you're tied in division record as well then they use your conference record. If your tied in that as well then record against Playoff eligible teams. By that point, usually there's some discrepancy.

So here's a little bit more. The Nets won on Monday, and the Celtics didn't play. +.5 the Nets gained on the Celtics. The Celtics lost on Tuesday. +.5 gain for the Nets. So a total of +1 was gained in the last 2 days. 

Now, I'm just looking at schedules, and I know the Nets are hot, but I might chime a loss in there for discussion sake. The key game that everything hopefully comes down to is Jan. 12th. Nets vs. Celtics.

Celtics schedule until that game, and I'm just making some predictions for arguments sake.

Jan 5th - Celtics @Dallas. I'd pick the Celtics, but Luka is a beast, so you never know. Celtics W

Jan 7th - Celtics @Spurs. Celtics W

Jan 9th - Bulls @Celtics I hope some (YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE) Doesn't bet a testicle against the Bulls. Celtics W 

Jan 11th - Pelicans @Celtics Toss up if Zion is gonna play but I think this is a Pelicans....while I was looking this up for the Nets I saw Zions out for 3 weeks so this is probably a Celtics win.

If my predictions are right, this would give the Celtics a record of 30 W / 12 L. I think last nights game was a slap in the face, and the Celtics are gonna be PISSED. I also think that smart with all his technicals and elections might see league action soon. I don't watch much Celtics, but I always see him getting thrown out.

And then we have Jan 12th 
Celtics @Nets 

Now, let's look at the Nets schedule.

Jan 4th - Nets @Bulls with how hot we are. This should be a win, but Derozan can go off. I see this as a trap game we win. W

Jan 6th - Nets @Pelicans so I just looked up Zions injury, and he's out 3 weeks, so this is a W

Jan 8th - Nets @Heat I see this as another trap game. In Miami, who has SEVERLY underperformed, but were what the 1 seed last year? Ultimately, another Nets win.

Jan 12th - Celtics @Nets So I see us both winning all our games until this showdown. The Celtics have an extra game in the time span between now and this game. The Nets have 3 1/2 days off before this game while it is a back to back for the Celtics with a somewhat injured but still dangerous Pelicans team. Now here's where the games played and those .5 wins come into play.

If they both win out, The Celtics are going to gain .5 on the Nets just simply due to the number of games played. So in this situation the if the Nets win, they'll be dead even with the Celtics at 30 W / 13 L. So will the Nets be the #1 seed? Let's take a look.

Another mistake. The Nets only have 12 Losses so if everyone wins out then they would take 1st. But just so I don't have to edit anymore let's say the Nets lose to like the Pelicans.

Head to Head.

The Nets vs Celtics would be 1-1 even tie.

Division Record.

The Nets division record is 5-2 with 4 over Tor 1 over Nyk and losses to Phi and Bos.

The Celtics division record is 4-0 with wins over Phi Brk Nyk and Tor.

So the Nets would be 6-2 if they win, and the Celtics would be 4-1. Simple math makes the Nets 3-1, which is .666 and the Celtics would be .750. So if they both win out till Jan 12th and the Nets win they'll still be 2nd seed.

I hope this helps because I typed it out on my phone, and it was a pain in the ass. I even proofread it kinda. Give U/swapan_99 a shout out to for posting a good start and making me stay up and extra 45 minutes typing this out.

One thing I wanted to add. This is a fantastic winning streak, but all streaks do end. Let's not get all butt hurt when they eventually lose.

GoNets,Atmosphere at Barclay's this season.,"Netsworld, 

We cannot deny one of the biggest criticisms of this team. That criticism being our fan base is ""non existent,"" Barclays is a cemetery, and all the fans we have now are band-wagoners. I am hoping to get to a game this year. I have loved the nets since I was a small child. I live in jersey and I am hoping to get to my first game since before the pandemic. My question for everyone, has the atmosphere at Barclays improved? Are the fans more engaged now and does it feel like around Brooklyn, people are embracing the nets more and more? On TV, it seems like more of the same. A lot of small cheers and what seems like a disinterested crowd. Am I wrong to think this? I have always thought the networks must be doing something to the crowd noise, cause I have spoken to fans who regularly attend games who say Barclays is awesome.

GoNets,KD's Affect On Nets' Defensive Rating,"I'm sure you're all familiar with how important Durant is to this team on both ends of the floor, but I was looking at defensive rating and was shocked at how bad things went. 

With KD, nets have a defensive rating of 109.4, which matches with Philly for around 10th best in the league. Without him, they have a defensive rating of 119.4—which is 10 points higher and would rank dead last in the NBA, 3.6 points worst than the Houston Rockets who are currently last. Furthermore, since January 15th (the day of KD's recent injury), the Nets' defensive rating is even lower at 121, which is 5.2 points worse than the last place team. 

Of course other guys, notably Claxton (DRTG without him is still way better than without KD at 111.4 though), have missed some games during this timeframe, so these numbers can be taken with a grain of salt. Even so, it's still astonishing how bad this team's defense gets without him.",23,4,2022-02-08,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/snc3id/kds_affect_on_nets_defensive_rating/

GoNets,(Long Post) What does the Nets' offense need to be successful?,"'Sup. Welcome to r/GoNets to all converted Knicks fans. And hey, fellow Nets fans. I know, losing hurts. This is my third long post/poop read here on the Nets' offense. This time I'll take a look into the future, and what the offense needs to be successful. I've outlined a few skills that may seem minor, but will be crucial down the line. Essentially, it's not all about shooting. Most of my posts can be found early on [my blog](https://ignisyon.wordpress.com/2017/02/09/2-9-sustainably-sourced-part-1/) or on TheBrooklynGame.com, 2-3 times a week. Enjoy!

**Constructing an NBA roster requires balance.** The GM needs to understand on-court schemes, but also must account for attitude and effort. Putting big-name talent that fails to gel usually results in disappointment (see Brooklyn Nets, 2013-2014). Assembling a high character team that lacks raw talent generally results in heartbreak…and lots of losses (see Brooklyn Nets, 2016-2017). 

The current Nets have a mix of veterans and unheralded talent. Even through 50 games, they are still experimenting with lineups. Sean Marks may have struck out in free agency this past summer, but it gave a glimpse into the types of players the Nets covet. Analyzing Kenny Atkinson’s system and its influences gives a clue on how Marks aims to build the offense. The Nets have a grocery list to cook up their offensive system. But unlike previous years, they’re looking for sustainably sourced ingredients. It IS Brooklyn, after all. But unfortunately, farmers markets and Whole Foods branches don’t sell draft picks or “unicorn” players.

As I’ve elaborated on previously, the Nets offense emphasizes team ball. It’s the antithesis of previous Nets teams that relied on star power to will them to victory. In the current NBA, lacking a superstar makes winning an uphill battle. Superstars command respect. The Nets lack a top tier player now, and likely for the near future. With their offensive system, the Nets plan on combating star power with ball movement and smart play. But for the offense to work, certain personnel are needed. The Nets may not have players on the level of the Atlanta Hawks and San Antonio Spurs cores, but they can still acquire players that run the offense optimally. Here are a couple of skills needed to run the Atkinson “React and Attack” (can I trademark that?) offensive system.

**Point guard play**

This is the primary building block in Kenny Atkinson’s ideal offense. It’s D’Antoni ball mixed with Spurs philosophy. The chief creator for any basketball team is the point guard, an extension of the coach. Strong point guard play dictates the pace of the offense, balancing passing, scoring, and play off-ball. The Hawks’ team ball featured strong point guard play from Jeff Teague, Shelvin Mack, and Dennis Schroder. All three of these guards were far from being top tier talent. Each player excels in different areas, but all read the offense quickly and make decisions on the fly. These players had the ability to attack the defense…

And find teammates on secondary action…

The systems Kenny Atkinson draws his offensive philosophies from feature strong point guard play. With a solid primary ball handler, the Nets may not have to run a full set if the guard recognizes an open lane or mismatch on the fly. The presence of a point guard to keep the team in check has been missed all season. The infamous Net scoring droughts, and the crippling team turnovers may have occurred less frequently if the team featured a ball handler confident in leading the offense. The Nets no doubt miss Jeremy Lin and, to a lesser extent, Greivis Vasquez, two leaders with experience running an NBA offense. They understand the flow of the game, and can read defensive coverage. Spencer Dinwiddie and Isaiah Whitehead, the two guards tasked to fill in Lin’s and Vasquez’s shoes, have limited lead ball handling experience, looking tentative at times. These two have not been able to control and manage the offense completely just yet. Comfort as a primary ballhandler, and management of the offense is a developmental aspect to monitor as the season progresses.

**Creators off the dribble**

The ability to dribble strong to the basket, and knowledge of when to shoot, and when and where to pass are valuable skills. In Atkinson’s motion offense, the drive and dish is an efficient way to attack opposing defenses. When done successfully, the attack generates open looks or free throws. It makes each pass more effective, with the defense scrambling. Being able to create off the dribble is a skill that multiple players should possess in the Nets’ offense. There should be at least three off the bounce threats on the court for optimal offensive sets. 

In Spurs-land, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili are two premier penetrators with PhD’s in the drive and dish. Kawhi Leonard has added the ability to create off the bounce as well, a key addition in his progression to superstardom. Even the Spurs’ bench unit has players adept in attacking the basket in Kyle Anderson and Patty Mills. The Hawks would often play two point guards down the stretch, to add an additional threat to put defenses on their heels. Even Kyle Korver, primarily known as a catch and shoot assassin, could attack to generate a better shot for himself or for his teammates. Take a look…

[Korver 2](https://gfycat.com/MintyMisguidedGoldfish)

[Korver 3](https://gfycat.com/ComplicatedMadeupArgentineruddyduck)

The ability to put the ball on the floor can set up strong looks right away, or if the defense recovers, swing to find another shot within the flow of the offense. The players Sean Marks targets do not have to be elite penetrators. They just need to make the right decisions when the defense reacts.

Big men have the chance to create off the dribble within Kenny Atkinson’s offense too. The two primary sets in the Nets offense, Strong and Weak, utilize a 4-out 1-in configuration with a big at the top of the key. Sometimes, that big comes off of a screen…

[Big Man Screen Hawks](https://gfycat.com/ZealousSameEquestrian)

The big can also be a pivot point, dishing it to a shooter above or a cutter below (that would be a dope band name)…

[Brand high post](https://gfycat.com/BareShowyBichonfrise)

Other times, the big can jet to the rim on a drive, a wrinkle the Nets have added this season with Trevor Booker and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson playing power forward. RHJ, in particular, has excelled at getting to the rim, usually driving for a layup with contact…

[RHJ Drive and Bucket](http://streamable.com/y4n6f)

Recently, RHJ has improved his finishing at the rim, drawing more fouls and going to the cup under control. On occasion, RHJ can drive and dish to a wing in the corner. 

Even the largest players can take it off the dribble. Al Horford and Paul Millsap were successful at generating offense off the dribble. Here, Millsap scores on an easy layup after faking out his defender on a closeout.

[Millsap easy layup](https://gfycat.com/BigEuphoricKouprey)

Millsap also is skilled enough to find a teammate low on a smart pass

[Millsap assist](https://gfycat.com/SnappyInsidiousHoki)

One of Brook Lopez’s strongest assets as an offensive threat is his ability to attack the paint from the perimeter. Although it may look awkward, it often is more effective, and more beneficial to the offense compared to his post ups. He can get a shot at the rim with the defense moving, or draw a foul on a rotating defender.

[Lopez attacks](http://streamable.com/qjoi9)

Lopez also has been able to find cutters off of his own drives. Two athletic Nets forwards, Quincy Acy and Trevor Booker, have shown the ability to get to the rim as well...

[Acy drive](http://streamable.com/aswdf)

[Booker drive](http://streamable.com/ca90m)

On any type of drive into the lane, it’s important to keep it simple. Nets turnovers often arise from over-dribbling in traffic, or from forcing up a contested shot when swarmed by defenders. Other Nets turnovers have stemmed from driving without a plan, allowing defenders to slide in for a charge. Looking for a foul is fine on a drive, but Nets players have often resorted to this technique a bit too much, without much success in getting the whistle. Future Nets players that attack the basket with control could improve efficiency on offense. 

**Cutters/Movers off the ball**

An underrated part of any player’s game is his off-ball movement. The ability to read how a defender is leaning, or catching him napping is a skill that could yield easy buckets. A top tier player like [Dwyane Wade built his Hall of Fame career by being an exceptional off ball player,](https://youtu.be/cKdToBv0vyc) using his basketball IQ and constant movement to get position for shots or drives. 

Any kind of movement off the ball, whether it’s screening away, curls (for the girls,) or backdoor cuts could complicate things further for the defense. The Nets have had possessions where a strong cut leads to an easy basket or good look from 3. Sean Kilpatrick moves particularly well off the ball when he’s not creating his own offense. A Brook Lopez post up has been a solid option for cutters the past three seasons. Bojan Bogdanovic, in particular, is proficient in cutting off-ball…

[Bogie cut](http://streamable.com/heo6c)

The initial action was a Brook Lopez postup. Bojan catches his defender napping, and darts to the rim, where Brook finds him for an easy layup. Bogdanovic scores on similar attacks often.

[Bojan+Lopez 2 man game](http://streamable.com/lb2qg)

Coming off of an inbounds play, Bogdanovic dumps an entry pass to Brook Lopez in the post. Bojan fakes a cut away from the ball, but runs hard to the strong side corner, receiving a handoff from Lopez for a good look from 3. Any post up play by the Nets should be accompanied by at least some off ball movement.

There have been times when the Nets offense is completely devoid of off ball movement, straying from the system or giving up on the set after the defense stymies the first action. This is when the Nets revert to isolation ball, which occurs often during Nets droughts. 

[Lopez post up no movement](http://streamable.com/6hz3a)

The problem with asking a player to call his own number is not the stopping of the ball. It’s the stopping of player movement that can kill an offense.

Off-ball screening is another minor offensive aspect that can pay major dividends. While not exactly the most successful, the Los Angeles Lakers, under Luke Walton, and the Portland Trailblazers under Terry Stotts use complex off ball screen action to free shooters, or as a decoy to open driving lanes. In an offense where players have free rein to shoot from the perimeter, being able to shoot off of an off ball screen can fuel the offense. The NBA’s best shooters come off of screens with intent. The shooter’s speed, paired with a strong screen, is a deadly weapon.

This season, the Nets offense has used off ball screens to set up the offense, out of Strong and Weak sets (refer to my first post on the Nets offense to see what it looks like). One reason the Nets’ ball movement has suffered at times is because players run through screens without any sense of urgency. Players like Stephen Curry, Kyle Korver, and JJ Redick, who could rain threes with their eyes closed, come off screens at full speed every time. Coming off a screen lackadaisically allows the defense time to adjust and close out. It may be a minor criticism, but it could be beneficial when assessing future Nets players.

*There is* much work to be done constructing the Nets roster. Offensive skills range far greater than shooting, dribbling and passing. The Nets could acquire a speedy point guard, or a slasher that gets into the lane at will, but their decision-making speed may determine if a possession ends in a basket or a turnover. I may have written way too much on the value of moving off of the ball, but it can be critical. At this point in a lost season, Marks and Co. should already be looking at players to target this summer in free agency and the NBA draft.

GoNets,"The Two Versions of Kyrie we Saw Today, and the word that divides them.","So i'm rewatching this presser and trying to make some sense of Kyrie.

Here's what I got.

Kyrie's first bit is awkward. His shoulders are tight, as is his demeanor. It's hard to get a read on him, and his words feel halting - awkward. He wants this to be good and he clearly cares, but his guard is up, and while positive, he's not comfortable.

But as he gets into the things that sold him on the Nets, he discusses the family atmosphere, which get's him to thinking about his grandfather, and then his grandfather's passing... and then the second Kyrie says the word 'depression', you see the weight fall off his shoulders, and a small smile emerge. You see the positive impact of him just saying it, getting it off his chest (and mind)...

This, clearly, is a man who's been feeling a lot of weight - the weight of his word (re: resigning) crumbling in Boston, the weight of close family passing, the weight of championships that should have been, and his true promise as a leader - a role that has thus far eluded him.

However, during this press conference, once you see him pay respects to his feelings - and the 'depression' wrought by his Grandddad's passing (and his distance, due to basketball), the entire tone of his time shifts - it's pretty dramatic, actually - the lightness - the smile, the willingness to engage, and the clear desire he has to \_talk\_ about where he is at, now.

So. here's to hoping Kyrie can continue to be honest - and open - with his teammates, this organization, and maybe (to some extent) his fans.  I've been watching Kyrie highlights since early July and.. while Im \_truely, deeply\_ sad to loose the aesthetics of D-Lo's game... if we had to choose one person who can offer up something equally awesome/transcendent but also sortof \_totally different\_, it would be Kyrie.

the brooklyn backcourt is bonkers.... and then we'll sub in Dinwiddie and the onslaught will \_just\_not\_stop\_

GoNets,13 Days Until Brooklyn Basketball. #13 Kendall Gill.,"Gill had a career year as a Net in '96-'97 after being dealt from Charlotte for Kenny Anderson. He remained steady even after the emergence of Kerry Kittles and debut of KVH.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Wiki: Kendall Cedric Gill (born May 25, 1968) is an American retired professional basketball player who now works as a television basketball analyst.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill was born in Chicago and attended Rich Central High School in Olympia Fields, Illinois. Graduating in 1986 as a senior, Gill led Rich Central to a 2nd-place finish in the IHSA class AA state boys basketball tournament. Gill led Rich Central in scoring with 54 points in the 4 games of the tournament finals, and was named to the six-player All-Tournament team.

&amp;#x200B;

After high school, Gill attended the University of Illinois. Playing four years for the Fighting Illini, Gill was a starter for his last three seasons. As a junior, Gill led the Fighting Illini to the 1989 Final Four before losing to Michigan on a last second shot. Also among that fabled ""Flyin' Illini"" squadron were future NBA players Nick Anderson, Marcus Liberty, Kenny Battle and Illini TV/radio broadcaster Stephen Bardo as well as four-year starter, Lowell Hamilton. As a senior, Gill led the Big Ten in scoring and was named a first-team All-American (UPI). Gill left Illinois as the 7th all-time leading scorer in school history. Gill's Illini earned NCAA bids each year he played. Gill also won the NCAA Slam Dunk championship at the Final Four his senior season.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill was elected to the ""Illini Men's Basketball All-Century Team"" in 2004.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill was chosen in the 1990 NBA draft as the fifth overall pick by the Charlotte Hornets, and was named First Team All-Rookie for the 1990–91 season. Kendall also participated in an NBA Slam-Dunk Competition. Gill played 15 seasons in the NBA. He averaged over 20 points as a second-year player for the Hornets in 1991–92 (20.5 ppg). He spent a majority of his career playing for the Hornets (including two separate stints).

&amp;#x200B;

Gill also played for the Seattle SuperSonics for two seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill was then traded to the New Jersey Nets. Gill had the best year of his career scoring-wise with the Nets in 1996–97 (21.8 ppg). In the 1998–99 NBA season, Gill led the league in steals as a member of the Nets. On April 3, 1999, he recorded 11 steals in a game against Miami, tying a single-game record set by Larry Kenon during the 1976–77 season. In this game, he also recorded 15 points and 10 rebounds for a rare Points-Rebounds-Steals triple double. In the 1999–00 season, he also made a half-court shot against the Orlando Magic that hit the top of the backboard and swished in the net.

&amp;#x200B;

He also was a member of the Miami Heat near the end of his career.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill played for the Minnesota Timberwolves as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill played for the Chicago Bulls for a season too. He wore number 13.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill played with the Bucks for a short period of time before retiring from the NBA.

&amp;#x200B;

In the 1998–99 NBA season, Gill led the league in steals as a member of the Nets. Gill's career totals include 12,914 points in 966 regular season games. He made an appearance as himself in a Nickelodeon TV Show My Brother and Me.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill was brought up in Matteson and lived in Matteson.

&amp;#x200B;

As a means to maintain his conditioning, Gill took up boxing, eventually entering the professional ranks. Gill had his first bout on June 25, 2005 at the age of 37.

&amp;#x200B;

He appeared on the January 23, 2008 edition of Spike TV's Pros vs. Joes.

&amp;#x200B;

On May 15, 2010, Gill sang a rendition of ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" at Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, as they took on the Pittsburgh Pirates.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill has provided analysis during pregame and postgame shows on Comcast SportsNet Chicago for Chicago Bulls games. On March 22, 2013, Gill was suspended by Comcast SportsNet for the remainder of the 2012–13 season after a reported physical altercation with analyst Tim Doyle in the Comcast SportsNet newsroom. In September 2013, Gill indicated that he was not returning to the station. However, he was rehired by Comcast SportsNet in late 2015.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2017, Gill was signed as a free agent in the BIG3 basketball league by Power to take the place of Corey Maggette after he suffered an injury during the season.

GoNets,I'd love to get T Spoon involved with the Nets.,"I'm gonna talk about the Liberty.  I get it's not for everyone, so if it's not your thing, cool.  Just walk on by.  

To those who haven't noticed, the Liberty are regularly packing Barclays.  They're also doing something unique in NYC - they're uniting the city's sports fans.  Even Spike Lee is now semi regular at Barclays, sitting next to Clara Wu Tsai.  They're getting basketball fans used to coming to Barclays frequently, where maybe some outside the borough wouldn't normally.  

One of the teams' legends is Teresa Weatherspoon. I think most NYC basketball fans at least know the name but she was a heart and soul player that fans loved and still do to this day.  I'd love the Liberty to bring her back in some way but they have a championship-winning coach.  Would she do a TV gig?  Maybe but she is a gym rat type, needs to develop players.  She would probably make an excellent college coach.  

She had a brief coaching stint with the Chicago Sky and a lot of players credited their development to her, namely Angel Reese.  She was part of the Pelicans' development team prior to that.  

Now, I'm a big believer in letting the coach choose his staff, but considering all the youth on the squad, they should have the largest developmental staff in the league.  Adding T Spoon to it could be a good experienced addition, as well as bringing in some fan support from Liberty fans to a team that's likely to lose 65 games this year.

GoNets,We’ve got a chance to make a big statement this week,"No way around it, the loss to LA was just brutal. But it’s being overhyped.. Media was always going to pounce all over it. Kyrie’s ejection, Drummond killing us. People trying to talk like it is some indicator of what a playoff series will be like. Lots of talk coming from that game 

But this week we got BIG matchup with Philly. Should be a great game with a playoff atmosphere. 
 Can shut a lot of people up with a win there. Interested to see how the front court does against Embiid. 

Tonight we got Wolves. Then Philly Wednesday, Charlotte and then Miami. 

Here’s a piece on our upcoming week💪🏼

Record predictions? I’m thinking 3-1 with a loss to Miami maybe.. Also depends on When we get Ky back

GoNets,What are the Brooklyn Nets’ team needs this offseason?,"Hello, I’m compiling what each NBA fanbase wants to see happen this offseason. The Brooklyn Nets are in a very strong position, but with a lot of empty roster spots this offseason, the Nets need a bench that will keep up with their stars.


—-


To start here are Brooklyn’s expiring contracts:

Spencer Dinwiddie

Jeff Green

Tyler Johnson

Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot

Bruce Brown

Blake Griffin

Alize Johnson (nonguaranteed)


So is there anyone you would want resigned and for how much? Moving on to free agency in general is there a specific player or role you want filled?


—-


For the draft Brooklyn has picks 27, 44, 49, 59. Is there a specific player you would like or just what kind of player archetype would you want. Also would you want to trade up or down in the draft


—-


And finally is there a player you want traded or a player you would like to trade for, and if so what would be a good offer?

GoNets,2021 Bag Policy,"What’s good team. I am tryna see a few games this year after work and was wondering if they still allow backpacks to be checked at the Dean St. entrance. I also carry a water bottle to work and was curious if they’d let me bring that in as well so long as I empty it before.

Update: Went to the Heat game. Bag was fine, but was told “buy a new water bottle or throw it in someone’s car.” Lfg Nets",11,10,2021-10-27,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/qh19g8/2021_bag_policy/

GoNets,Visiting NY. Go to Nets weekend or weekday game?,"Hey everyone,

I am from Belgium and am visiting New York for a week in February. The three persons I am travelling with and I want to go watch an NBA game while we're there. Options seem to currently be:

- Brooklyn Nets vs Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday Feb 04 at 12:00pm (about 27 dollars per ticket)
- Brooklyn Nets vs Houston Rockets on Tuesday Feb 06 at 7:30pm (about 50 dollars per ticket)

We want to keep the cost down as much as possible to have money to spend on other things, but we still want to see a decent game though. Is there a big difference in crowd ambiance atmosphere between weekend or weekday games? The Milwaukee Bucks game seemed like a good deal, but because it is twice as cheap I am afraid that there won't be a nicely filled stadium. However for the Houston Rockets game, I am afraid Brooklyn Nets might perhaps lose pretty hard heh.

Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!",10,9,2017-12-10,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/7iumsx/visiting_ny_go_to_nets_weekend_or_weekday_game/

GoNets,Best Seats for My First Nets Game? Need Advice!,"**Hi everyone,**

I know this topic has been discussed before, but I’d really appreciate your help in making my visit to NY worthwhile!

I’ll be in town later this month and want to catch the Nets vs. OKC game on February 26. I’ve found tickets within my budget but can’t decide between:

* **Section 31, Row 17**
* **A corner section (204, 212, 220, or 228), Row 2**

Does Section 31 offer a better experience in terms of view and atmosphere, or is Row 17 too far back? I’ve seen some posts recommending the corner sections—would that be a better choice?

Also, do you think this game is a good pick for a basketball fan? Since it’s on a Wednesday, I’m not sure what the atmosphere will be like.

EDIT: what are my chances of getting better seats by waiting until the last minute for prices to drop? 

If you have any seat recommendations or tips to make my first NBA game unforgettable, I’d love to hear them!

Thanks so much!",8,5,2025-02-09,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1ils8ru/best_seats_for_my_first_nets_game_need_advice/
GoNets,"First time visiting the Barclays center, couple questions.","Visiting from the UK and bought tickets for the pre season game against philly and I have a couple of questions. 

I've been on the Barclays Center website and it says I can either go to Atlantic Avenue, Lafayette Avenue or Fulton Street. Is Atlantic Avenue really busy as it's the closest? Should I go to one of the other stations and miss the crowds?

Should I get some food/beer at the barclays center or are the prices extortionate? I'm used to paying $8/9 for a beer at soccer games in the UK. Anywhere nearby you'd recommend to grab a beer and a burger beforehand? Someone suggested Cyprus Avenue in another thread, wouldn't mind going somewhere with a bit of an atmosphere with other Nets fans, will there be like that?

Also, should I go and see the warm-ups? Not something I normally do at soccer games but that's because they don't let you drink beer in your seat.

The New York Cosmos are now playing at MCU Park and had their home opener yesterday. It's a fun atmosphere, which should only be more fun when Coney Island opens up for the summer.
