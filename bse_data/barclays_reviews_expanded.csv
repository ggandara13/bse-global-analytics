Google,4,"Barclays Center feels like one of those places where Brooklyn shows its real scale and energy. It sits right in the middle of movement — subways below, traffic around, people coming from every direction. There’s always a sense that something is happening here, even when there’s no event inside.
The building itself is heavy and solid, with a modern, almost industrial look that fits Brooklyn well. It doesn’t try to be elegant or flashy — it feels strong, urban, and purposeful. When there’s a game or a concert, the whole area comes alive: crowds gather, voices mix, lights reflect off the streets, and the pace of the neighborhood shifts.
Inside, everything is organized for large events — sports, concerts, shows. The sound, the scale, and the flow of people all remind you that this is one of the main gathering points of the city. But even outside, just standing near the entrance, you can feel the energy moving through the area.
Barclays Center isn’t just an arena.

Google,1,"The staff is extremely rude and unaccommodating to disabled people. Example one, the employee outside of the venue just consistently scream “go all the way down! To the right to the right to the right!” Then you get inside and they are worse than TSA. You’ve got 4 different employees shouting 4 different directions at you at the same time. And you do not have enough plastic bowls and bins to pass get the amount of people through security in the amount of time you are trying to do it in. No where on you website does it say do not wear steel toed shoes, I had to go back and forth through the metal detectors and then take my boots off on the floor in the middle of the crowd trying to inside, made it through finally and then the employees were just snapping and yelling about getting my items from the bowl, and I had to try and put my boots back on again I’m in the middle of the walk way getting my fingers and belongings stepped on. It doesn’t end there, the people who scan the tickets are rude then you try to look at the artist merchandise for sale and you’ve got more employees screaming at you to move. The ONE THING those employees could do that would actually be useful is help people find their seats except the don’t, they just tell you if you are wrong but don’t help you find the right way. It’s up to all the paying attendees to help each other. Then by the time the event is over, you are getting screamed at once again by the employees “GET OUT GET OUT GO THIS WAY GET OUT!!!” Maybe don’t have exit signs up if you don’t want people to follow them? I don’t get it. Over all, the staff ruined my experience and I traveled all the way from Virginia Beach for this concert. Very rude, very ugly. I am a disabled adult with ASD and I have slow processing, having these employees hound me like I’m in bootcamp was not how I wanted to remember my night that I paid A LOT of money for. Ticket purchase through Ticketmaster is always terrible, you should use your own services, or a smaller company like brown paper tickets. Communication should be clear about no steel toe boots or you’ll have to take them off in advanced. This knowledge would be helpful to people. Unless you take the subway, the Barclay center is located at an extremely congested intersection, so commute and parking are awful. The event entertainment itself is great but the experience is ruined by the staff so what could have been a 10 out of 10 is now a 5 out of 10 rating because of the horrible staff.",12/18/2025 22:17:04,Alec Janus,2025-12-18 22:17:04

Google,4,"Came here to watch a Brooklyn Nets game. Barclays Center is a very nice arena—modern, clean, and well laid out—with a good amount of food and drink options throughout the venue.

The staff was friendly overall, but they were clearly required to follow some very strict rules when it came to drinks. I ordered a whiskey neat and was told they had to add a few ice cubes. At one point, my wife was holding both my drink and hers while I went to the bathroom, and a staff member stopped her and said he would make her pour it out unless he saw me come back. He actually waited until I returned. I’ve never experienced that at any game before, so it was pretty surprising—maybe they’ve had issues in the past.

The vibe in the arena felt a bit low, and it didn’t seem like there were many fans there, which could be because the team isn’t playing particularly well right now. Still, the arena itself is solid and well run, just be prepared for very strict drink policies.",12/15/2025 03:30:06,Kevin Drost,2025-12-15 03:30:06

We enter the Barclay’s Center and went to the bar to grab a drink before the game with no issues as we provided our UK driving license ID. When half time comes around we go to another bar to be served a second drink however were refused due to not having our UK passports with us or US Driving license ? We explained we got served earlier and he said this should not have happened? We then go to another bar to see if this is correct and the guy at the other bar was going to serve us with our UK driving license. We then had security called to us and were threatened to be kicked out if we do this again even though we had valid UK driving license and are 26 years old. Why would we take our passport out? This was not specified before we visited. Completely ruined the night being threatened to be kicked out. Won’t be coming again. Staff are awful.,12/05/2025 21:41:09,Molly Burns,2025-12-05 21:41:09

Then David Tao, the godfather of Chinese R&B, came out with that smooth, soulful voice on classics like “愛很簡單”, “黑色柳丁”, and of course “Melody” – the crowd was singing every single word.
The production was top-tier: crystal-clear sound, stunning visuals, and the lighting perfectly matched the emotional vibe of every song. Barclays Center’s acoustics made G.E.M.’s belts and David Tao’s silky runs sound even better than on the albums.
Easily one of the best concerts I’ve ever attended in NYC. If these two ever tour again, I’m buying tickets the second they drop. Thank you Barclays Center for hosting this historic night – 1000/10 would relive it again! 🔥🎤

I thought a big stadium type venue would be a logistical nightmare but it’s very well designed to get a crowd in and out of very efficiently. The bathrooms are plentiful, well located and quite clean. Stevie Nicks must attract a lot of women so the lines at the bathroom were a little long but really not more than a 5 minute wait.

Yelp,2,"Why 2 stars? Because it was the definition of soul-less.     ---   ---   ---  Barclays Center was the third arena I visited in three nights and it was easily the worst. I was here (as a Cavs fan) for the Nets home opener and my main takeaway is that you would hardly even know you were in the Nets' arena when you're walking around the concourses. I covered every inch of the lower and upper levels and it felt like I was just in a generic arena that the Nets were borrowing for the night.  Where is the team spirit? Where are the murals? Where are the player faces? You have to really hunt them down to find them. And don't get me wrong: I know the Nets are a bad team as of this writing. They don't have many marketable players. But I've never visited a sports venue that felt more like a neutral site than this one.   Secondly, and probably even more important: getting into this arena was the hardest and most inefficient process I've ever experienced. I've now been to 17 arenas for either an NBA or NHL game and this easily ranks #17.  When we arrived at the building, gates had already been open for about 30 minutes, but it looks like about 20K people were all standing outside the main gate, waiting to be let in.   We eventually were led by an employee to follow them around the corner to a gate with fewer people in line. There were maybe 20ish people walking behind this woman, and when we got there, we found just as crazy of a line as all of the ones at the main entrance. Eventually, she took us around another corner, where we waited in a slightly less long line than the others. It took forever and a day to get inside and we had to rush to our seats just to see tip-off. I know it's Game One, but this was a trainwreck.  In addition, a couple other pet peeves:  1) This arena is designed similarly to Dallas and San Antonio, where being in the upper deck feels like you are incredibly far away from the court. There are other arenas where you feel much more on top of the action in the upper deck: Houston, Chicago and Utah come to mind.   2) All of these venues tend to not have a lot of room between each aisle, but I think this is the worst I've ever seen. Numerous people almost fell down trying to get from their seat to the aisle, throughout the night. There is virtually zero room to do this and I'm not sure how they didn't test this in the design.   Barclays is my 12th NBA arena to visit, and now I can say I've done it, but I'll never need to return. It's new-ish and clean, but that's about all I can say in the positive column about it.",11/08/2025 13:28:11,Brett N.,2025-11-08 13:28:11

There really isn't a bad seat in the house--every section feels comfortable with plenty of legroom and space.  There are lots of food and drink options inside (prices are steep, but it's New York, so no surprise there). The bars always have great signature drinks, and the big merchandise store is a nice bonus.  Security is smooth, especially if you don't have a bag because there's a separate line that moves quickly. The staff is always friendly and welcoming, and I love that they thank you as you leave.  Restrooms are easy to find, and if you don't want to eat inside, there are plenty of restaurants right outside. There are a few parking lots within walking distance should you decide to drive over.

Yelp,1,"I went to see Sleep Token at the Barclays center last night (9/22/25). The show itself was great, but I unfortunately left with a bad taste of the arena itself.   Before the show, my husband and I stopped at a snack stand. The price screen showed that a regular soda was $7.75 and a souvenir cup was $9. We decided to buy one souvenir cup to share.   The snack stand had Mashgin automated check outs, so we placed the cup on the sensor and the price came up to $12.75 plus tax. I was confused-- the screen says souvenir cups are $9- so I asked for clarification from the gentleman working.  He informed me that the price on the screen was for ""Liberty Souvenir cups"" which aren't sold during concerts. I was a bit frustrated because if that's the case, then the screen shouldn't say $9, but decided to pay for it anyway. Also, the cup I received was a hard plastic""Brooklyn"" branded cup-- so feels very souvenir cup? Why are we adding $3 because it's a concert? But whatever...   As I was tapping my card to the screen, a second drink for $8 appeared on the check out screen for no apparent reason. A very nice older lady who was working there tried to stop me before I paid, but my card had already processed a transaction for $22.56.   I was upset because I was NOT planning on spending that much for a drink, but in an attempt to soften the blow and not deal with a lengthy refund process, I asked the nice older lady if I could just get a second drink since I paid for it.   She brought one over from the cooler and a younger lady behind the counter immediately had an attitude. She asked why I was getting a second drink to which we explained the situation. She aggressively asked if I had a receipt, which I did not, because one was not printed. She got on the phone with a huff and asked me to wait for her supervisor to arrive. I pulled up my bank statement in the meantime to show that I was in fact charged $22.56 and she just rolled her eyes and said ""wait"". I waited about 10 minutes and no one showed up. Eventually she looked at the gentleman from before and said ""just pour it"".   So not only was I overcharged for an item that displayed a different price, but I was charged for a drink that I very obviously didn't have on the sensor AND then I'm given attitude because I didn't want to be out an extra $8 for no reason. Like these items are already outrageously priced ($8 for a 20oz bottles worth?) just let me get what I paid for.   To top it off, my husband ended up getting a pretzel while we were waiting that was rock solid and very dry, so not worth the $8 for that either.",09/23/2025 16:30:11,Ashley F.,2025-09-23 16:30:11
Yelp,2,"Drinks are overpriced, a particular female employee was rude. Ok, so I missed the part about not being able to bring a lighter with me. I asked if I could get it back after the show she said no. I wanted it back but she would allow me to go back out once I entered. So my 30 dollar lighter I'm sure is being enjoyed by the staff. I'd like to add the fact the they also said no smoking or vaping allowed. Well I got news for you. I smelled cigarettes, and definitely saw at least 2 people vaping in front of us. My motive was to enjoy my cigar after the show, not smoke while inside (common sense).  My next complaint is not about the arena, but it's about the ""young adults"" in front of that spilled their drinks more than drinking it. They couldn't stay still and literally spoke through out the whole concert. I'm not sure why even go to a concert if you're just going to keep talking. Just my 2 cents. For me, MSG will always be better. And one last thing, the sound of the concert sucked. Performance was great but the sound system sucks.",09/21/2025 17:05:16,Jeff L.,2025-09-21 17:05:16
Yelp,5,"I'm a WNBA fan through and through. As a lady basketball player, I want to support women's sports. While my home team is Las Vegas Aces, that doesn't stop me from traveling to other cities to see their team compete.   I always here how hype the NY crowd is at the Liberty games and decided to check it out for myself and even moreso that Natasha Cloud is on the team.   There are several entrances to get in but you must go in the entrance for your section. That can be good and bad depending how much walking you can do comfortably. I recently injured my foot, so it was a lot of walking. The staff were actually friendly. I wasn't expecting this based on other reviews.   While the Liberty lost to the Sky, it was a good game, but I must admit that Ellie stole the show. Ellie has to be the hardest working mascot that I've seen across all sports.   I had a great time and wouldn't hesitate yo come back to another Liberty game.",09/14/2025 00:16:58,Tara H.,2025-09-14 00:16:58
Yelp,1,"The security at this venue is unnecessarily aggressive and hostile. They have a strict bag checking policy (which is valid considering the size of the place and the amount of people entering at once) but treat patrons as if they are going through a check point in a prison rather than a concert venue.  If your items aren't approved according to their policy, they are discarded against your will without any options to retrieve them after the show. You are met with rude and unprofessional staff, antagonizing remarks and  even threats of physical altercations initiated by someone checking your bag (who is supposed to be making the event secure?). The level of unprofessionalism exhibited  is completely unwarranted  and I hope for the sake of Barclays they do a more thorough investigation on the people they employ and the environment they create for paying costumers. Tickets for this venue aren't necessarily cheap and to be treated like an inmate for having a lighter in your bag by a security guard on a power trip is going to make this place go lose business very quickly.",09/04/2025 18:03:33,Jessica V.,2025-09-04 18:03:33

Mary J Blige entry was chaos, just get in where you fit in.  However, my latest visit to the NY Liberty game was a hit ! entry was effortless, clear concise entry and seating points. Once inside the venue the beverage and food prices was typical, I was lucky enough to find Pops Patties at $9.00 for a Jerk Chicken Pattie, it was reasonable price, ordering is through QR code and your name or number is called for pick up.  We did purchase overpriced merch and popcorn but the NY Liberty won and the halftime and in between time is a party.  Ellie the mascot, turned up ! It was so much fun!

Yelp,4,"While they don't have the legacy and fame of an MSG, you can say that this is the home of a defending NY pro-basketball team. You couldn't have uttered that sentence since 1972. For that reason alone, Barclays is a place to visit to watch a fun and family-friendly NY Liberty game. The steepness of the upper level seats used to give me a lot of anxiety, but recent visits to the arena in sections closer to the court has really changed my view on how great it is to watch a game here.  Crowds are generally great, building is clean, and the convenience of all subway lines converging at Atlantic Ave is quite perfect for commutes. The fact that events at Barclays are still somewhat affordable is great to see.",08/27/2025 05:05:57,Nelson W.,2025-08-27 05:05:57

In 2014 I saw a Brooklyn Nets vs. Toronto Raptors game with some Canadian fans. I also saw Arcade Fire in 2014, which was amazing. However, I think the coolest event I've been to was ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" film with live music from Danny Elfman, a full orchestra and cast members including Cathrine O'Hara in 2017. Barclays was also the hub of bus transportation to Manhattan during hurricane Sandy in 2012. Architecturally / construction wise, for those of us who worked nearby during the construction, it's took some time getting used to it - but ultimately is an amazing resource for the community. It's now become a landmark - I'll meet you at Barclays. I hope to attend more memorable events here again soon!",07/24/2025 18:12:23,Amanda H.,2025-07-24 18:12:23
Yelp,4,"Incredible Experience with Just One Small Tweak Needed  We attended the Tyler, the Creator concert at Barclays Center and had the pleasure of experiencing it from Row 1, Section 8 of JetBlue @ The Key and let me just say, the concert itself was 5 stars all the way. Tyler brought the energy, the stage design was electric, and the vibe was off the charts.  As for JetBlue @ The Key, it's easily one of the best ways to enjoy a concert at Barclays. The suite experience comes with a ton of perks that elevate the night beyond just a great seat. The seats themselves were extra comfortable, with a perfect view of the stage and butler service that delivered food and drinks right to us yes, seriously.  Inside the suite, you get:  Private restrooms (huge plus no lines!)  A cash bar  Complimentary food that, while not the most varied, was well-stocked throughout the night and definitely satisfying  Dedicated security and a peaceful atmosphere before and after the show  Access to a private lounge area that felt like a mini-VIP hangout  The only reason this is 4 stars and not 5 is the timing. Even with a premium ticket, they didn't allow early entry ahead of the general public the doors opened for everyone at 6:30pm. It would've made the experience even more exclusive and smooth if JetBlue @ The Key ticket holders were let in a bit earlier to relax and enjoy the suite.  That said, the overall experience was fantastic. Between the amazing concert, the front-row view, great service, and top-tier comfort, this is absolutely worth it if you're thinking about upgrading your event night. Highly recommend JetBlue @ The Key for your next big concert or game just hope they tweak that early access policy in the future.",07/21/2025 19:05:24,Diego P.,2025-07-21 19:05:24

Horrible experience it felt Humiliating, makes me never want to come back. Ghetto staff doesn't want to work but want to be paid. They should work at a correctional facility or do sensitivity training. If i can put zero stars i would, they deserve less then nothing.

Yelp,1,"Very disappointed with the Security Staff at the Barclay Center! My friend & I went out to smoke and when we went back in our bags were physically searched...even though the women that went in before & after that just had their bags put through the x-ray machine....which is not the issue. The issue is that they found a lighter in my friend's bag...THAT SHE GOT INTO AT THE EVENT....and they wanted to take it from her. Security removed it from her bag...my friend said it's ok we are going to leave now and took the lighter back. Security proceeded to say "" B***h if you touch that lighter, I will slap you"" and then threatened that she would be waiting for my friend outside when she got off work. This was extremely uncalled for. Management would not give their names for us to write a complaint & she did absolutely nothing about what had happened. We missed the whole end of the event & wasted $160 tickets. I have tried to reach out to Barclay's numerous times to file a complaint but no response. Do better when hiring your security staff & with training Barclay's...it is totally unacceptable the way we were treated. They even made me wait outside in the cold when I had nothing to do with the situation while waiting for the Manager.",05/05/2025 17:00:09,Kristin P.,2025-05-05 17:00:09

Yelp,4,"Barclays is a super fun stadium out in BK that screams old school hip hop. Renowned for selling out shows to the likes of JZ and the Notorious B.I.G., the Nets incorporate that vibe into their basketball games. I've also seen a fun monster truck rally here.  Pretty much any seat is a good seat and depending on which team is in town, it's fairly reasonable to snag tickets. I truly prefer this stadium over MSG and visibility is substantially better. The food is also decent with all the classics.",04/16/2025 20:50:00,Taylee M.,2025-04-16 20:50:00
Yelp,2,"Boy, has TD Garden spoiled me. This was honestly one of the worst basketball game experiences I've had, and I'm counting a few noncompetitive high school varsity games I witnessed from the comfort of a stuffy gymnasium. My top-tier chum who literally went to the school of hospitality and I came here on Friday for the Nets/Clippers game. We'd gotten free tickets in a really good location - row 10 behind the visitors' bench. It seemed like an especially ideal spot because (spoiler alert) the Nets are not good at all right now, so the best players to witness were very likely going to be on that aforementioned bench.  This got off to a rough start immediately. We had access to a VIP-ish entrance in the back of the arena on Dean Street, which definitely had fewer people than the main entry point, but still had a wait of about 10 to 15 minutes since we were a little late (I think we showed up around 7:25pm, so within just a few minutes of tip). I was coming directly from work and had a larger messenger bag with me. When we got to the security checkpoint, I was told by the guard that I had to go to a completely different line that had an X-ray scanner because of the size of my bag. Really frustrating (and the customer service was abysmal - instead of apologizing for the disconnect, etc., this guy just sullenly pointed in the general direction of another line and tersely said, ""Different line."") and there is absolutely NO signage anywhere in this area to guide patrons to the correct/appropriate lines for this issue. An incredibly easy fix and there's no excuse for it. That extended our overall wait time by another five or 10 minutes - thankfully the crowd was thinning out or this would have been even more annoying. In contrast, the TD Garden security situation is a breeze and has never taken me more than two minutes to get through.  A huge factor in the equation here - and it really can't be emphasized enough - is that the Brooklyn Nets are pretty atrocious right now. Without looking at the standings, I can't imagine there are more than two or three teams with a worse record, and it's reflected in the lack of name recognition (I consider myself a pretty engaged fan of professional sports and I could only name two players in the starting lineup), as well as the lackluster environment overall. I've been to my share of games in all four major US professional sports - including some ROUGH situations with my beloved NY Mets between their 2000 World Series appearance and the emergence of Jose Reyes and David Wright - and this was about as mausoleum-esque as it gets. Keep in mind that this was a Friday night AND they were playing a legit playoff team in the LA Clippers. Just a rough vibe, and it's hard to know how much of that is about Barclays or the team specifically, or a combo. But it had a big impact. When there's an electricity in the crowd, you can really feel that and it dramatically improves the outing.   Another issue from my perspective is that it's just too dark and gloomy here. If memory serves, part of the pitch when they moved this franchise to Brooklyn was that they were really going to embrace the ""urban"" aspect of their surroundings, which was reflected in the color scheme of both the uniforms and the arena. But I think when you're literally surrounded by blacks and grays and little in the way of literal lighting, it's a tough vibe. How excited can a fanbase get if it feels like they're sitting in a movie theater?  One highlight for me personally was that we coincidentally ended up attending Drew Timme's NBA debut (a player I'm very familiar with as a Gonzaga fan), who's been toiling in the G League since going undrafted a few years ago. After an awkward start, he ended up with a double-double in his debut, a rarity. Very pleasing and because it's so quiet in the arena, we're pretty sure he heard me yell, ""United we zag!"" after he ended up at the foul line - literally the only perk of a non-electric atmosphere. Hopefully he sticks around because he has the gritty intangibles that should in theory make him a fan favorite.  The biggest selling point of this arena is that it's within a stone's throw of Park Slope and all of the great food/drink offerings that edgy neighborhood provides. That doesn't speak well of Barclays, unfortunately.",03/30/2025 12:25:54,Emma G.,2025-03-30 12:25:54
Yelp,5,One thing I remember about the Barclays center was the food. If you're constantly in a rush and forget to make dinner reservations don't worry the Barclays elevates their chicken tenders and fries to the next level. This time around I decided to give Fuku a shot and honestly the silky white cheese dipping sauce alone would make me return for the experience.  Asked around for ice cream and caught a juniors with a minimal line and i made the right choice with the red velvet cheesecake slice.   For drinks the Brooklyn Pilsner was a refreshing alternative but after the half the Brooklyn mule stole the show with a souvenir cup. Expect longer than average lines and a tight security clearance that puts TSA to shame. After you entered from a bodega in the corner to a beef patty and coco bread pick up was a pleasant Brooklyn surprise for a Monday night,03/11/2025 16:47:51,Gissell M.,2025-03-11 16:47:51
Yelp,1,"So let me make sure I have the straight. You confiscate my cigarette lighters at the door and then when I choose to bring them back to my car and re-enter, you refuse to return my property, telling me that once they are in the bin, we cannot return them. When I think about that after the fact, it seems like that should be illegal. Anyway, I got in my car, and went home. Screw the show, I am in no mood to see anything after this idiocy. You can go straight to hell. I will never set foot in this place again, unless maybe Jesus Christ or the Buddha are making an appearance. And even then I would have to think about it.

Yelp,3,"It's relatively clean and since the Nets generally stink, it's usually not too crowded so getting inside is pretty quick and inexpensive.  Lots of subway entrances and exits around as well.  Food obviously isn't cheap and lines are long though, so I'd recommend eating beforehand.  Just remember to be careful on what you bring.  I've seen the Nets and Globetrotters here (as well as a few other events) a few times and I've had lots of things confiscated at the security checkpoint.  Metal water bottles, bagels, etc. Don't bring outside food or water.",02/16/2025 19:03:32,Matthew W.,2025-02-16 19:03:32
Yelp,5,"I came to see Disney on ice (Frozen and Encanto) with my 4 year old and 4 month old and it was a great time. We did have to go around the block a couple of times to find street parking at 6:45pm on a weekday but there are parking garages ($$) if you can't find public parking. Upon arrival the check in process was pretty quick and everyone was very excited for us. We had seats in section 8 and it was a great view to the ice rink. We brought noise cancelling headphones for our 4 month old but in case you don't have , guest relations has some (they're one size fits all) for the exchange of your state ID. We ended up not needing the headphones, the noise was mild. My baby slept through most of it. My 4 year old on the other hand, loved it and honestly so did I - excellent show and performers. I don't know that I'd recommend for a kid smaller than 3 years old because it was around 2 hours long and it's hard for them to stay still.  For food , they had like 3 different stands with fast food, I chose paisanos burgers and went with the burgers , the line was very long. The burgers (not featured ) were eh and around $16 each , but it did the job of filling me up. I tried my daughter's chicken fingers and those were surprisingly really good- get those instead of the burger (spent $75 on our food). They also had several snack places opened and gift shops , we got my daughter some memorabilia (bubble machine $35, cup $18 ).   Overall, the venue is good , the show was awesome and I'd definitely recommend both. Do come prepared to spend $$$ money as it's not a cheap night out.",02/09/2025 06:47:05,Carla O.,2025-02-09 06:47:05

Unfortunately, the food was disappointing--the burger and fries were cold, and the middle of the burger was hard. I ended up throwing out the $21 meal.  To make matters worse, I had to leave the game at halftime due to severe stomach issues, which turned into full-blown food poisoning. I missed the rest of the week of work because of it.  Not sure if I'll return to Barclays Center anytime soon, but if I do, I'll definitely be avoiding that food stand.",01/26/2025 15:46:44,chris w.,2025-01-26 15:46:44

Yelp,1,"The Barclays Center is great but unfortunately they partner with STUBHUB. STUBHUB IS THE WORST Here is one crooked scheme used. Stubhub lists tickets for sale, usually at a better than expected price. Customer purchases the tickets . Then the wrong tickets ( another date ) are electronically sent to the customer. All the customer see's is the Brooklyn Nets thinking they have the right tickets. You go to The Barclays Center on a Tuesday but have Thursday tickets in your hand. CHECK THE DATE - Stub Hub will offer you a refund and someone from Pakistan, Vietnam or Thailand will say, "" WE SO SORRY FOR YOUR INCONVENIENCE - WE WILL ISSUE YOU REFUND...OK "" NO it is not OK .

Yelp,4,"I would say it is more of a 4.5. This was my first time at Barclays Center. It is a great venue to see a concert. We were lucky to have floor seats, row 5. The seats were great but I stood most of the time. The acoustics were amazing, as was the singer!!!  We were invited to the Qatar VIP Lounge. They had dedicated Mariah themed drinks for the evening, but you could really order whatever you like. The drinks were high quality and tasted awesome..The food was ok. I really liked the avocado toast. The avocado was fresh. The chicken was pretty good and the taquitos were meh. I would think for a VIP lounge for invited guests, the food could have been higher quality.   I would say the food is probably where they lose 1/2 a star, along with every other concert venue...not having enough Ladies bathrooms!! All in all, it seems like people all over the venue had a good view of the performer.",12/29/2024 05:39:17,Michelle F.,2024-12-29 05:39:17
Yelp,4,Great place to catch a game; this place must do some serious business as they had like 3 different games in one day. I was lucky enough to see my terps win over Syracuse. The one thing that really sucked was the fact at half time ALL the concession stands in the building seemed to be closed or as if they couldn't or wouldn't operate all of them - so the four that were open had lines out the door.   I have been to many sporting events all over the US and I've never experienced this.   Seats were awesome and the place is clean and visually appealing as well as right off the subway.,12/22/2024 14:54:18,Courtney E.,2024-12-22 14:54:18
Yelp,5,"I had a fantastic experience at The Barclays Center tonight. Moving thru security is like LGA but much faster and more friendlier. Once you get thru,  the place was moving and shaking, bars were on the left and right.   We found our seats quickly. I like the variety of locations available for wine and cocktails including Jay Z's upscale 40/40 Club and world famous Junior's Cheesecake. I'm also impressed because we had last minute seats in the 200 section. We could see the main stage. There are big screens and surround sound around the Barclays' so you definitely see and hear.   Parking garage  available but driving isn't necessary. This is one of the most accessible places in Brooklyn.

Section 23 is a dedicated area for kiddos to play a series of video games to win prizes and can even get memorabilia- personally autographed by the players. Barclay itself is a circular maze with signage everywhere to pinpoint the section and row for your seats; it does get a bit hectic as the crowds gathered in the concession area; thankfully all staff personnel were really nice and helpful to direct us to our seats and even allow me to take pictures near center court. Concession food is super expensive (though, Glaze Donuts were giving complementary baked goods pre-game); Bathrooms were kept orderly and very clean and wait time was fast and quick.

They will not refund or credit you because event orginizer has a policy. Ticketmaster pretends not to know who event orginizer are.   In our case, Justin Timberlake showed up at 09:30PM, so 50,000 people were sitting and waiting from 7.30PM in their seats listening to DJ playing radio tunes from the 80s. Remember this.

Yelp,5,"I have visited Barclays Center for several New York Nets and Liberty games in the previous years. The best times were during the Kevin Durant era with huge crowds and great games. I love the area and the vibe of being in Brooklyn. It is in a great location right by the two train. As soon as you leave the station you get to embrace the Brooklyn experience. There are several stores and restaurants nearby to hang out before the game. Day or night there is always something going on in this area.   The nice thing about going to games in the Barclays Center is that it is much easier and cheaper than going to MSG. You get to see your favorite opposing team for half the price that you would in Manhattan. Getting inside is quick and easy. My favorite part of the stadium is standing area in the first level. If you have tickets in the higher levels you can come down and watch the game without spending more money. There is usually a large crowd of people hanging out here so come by early if you want a front row view.  The food choices are great. You can go your typical Brooklyn route and get Junior's cheesecake which is a fan favorite. Fuku provides the spicy chicken sandwiches and fries. As with any stadium, food options here are expensive. Drinks can set you back $16 or so. It is highly recommended to come early and try out one of the local eateries and then attend the game.   The games are usually great. For the last couple of years the Nets have been doing well. The Liberty play during the summer season. It is always a great environment to watch a game. I went this past week to see the Liberty in the playoffs. I was able to see them win and go to the next round. They even had a half time show by Ja Rule. That was a throwback which I did not expect. You can usually find halftime shows by local rap artists here which is great.",10/06/2024 02:44:00,Tarun B.,2024-10-06 02:44:00
Yelp,1,I attended the Monster Truck Live Pre show which started at 10 am as well as the regular scheduled event for 1230. It was total chaos even before the doors opened. One staff member stated that all the doors would be opened so of course everyone started to separate to the additional entrances only to have another staff member state that only 2 doors were going to be used which caused a ton of confusion . Then the event was so UNORGANIZED that they confused VIP with the regular pre show attendees. The actual pre show was good for what it was. Now we are waiting for the arena to open so we can get our seats but of course people want food. The food vendors were not opened AT ALL even though they have an event scheduled for 10 am you would think they would make special arrangements to open the vendors a little earlier than 11 30. So now you have a rush of people waiting to get food and they were so unprepared. BROOKLYN BANGERS AND DOGS STAFF in the BARCLAYS CENTER were so RUDE AND NASTY. The pretzels were not done at all and they had a VERY LIMITED AMOUNT of hot dogs already prepared. Do better please. As expensive as everything is in that place you would at least expect GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ORGANIZATION,09/28/2024 20:27:18,Mardeana B.,2024-09-28 20:27:18
Yelp,1,"I bought three tickets for my children to the  Hot Wheels monster jam as part of a fundraiser for PS 321.  my brother offered to take my boys to the show so I transferred the tickets to him.  purchasing the tickets required me to download the Barclays app, Brooklyn Nets app and open a Ticketmaster account.  There was no way to print out the tickets and only one way to transfer them.  when my brother arrived at the arena, they wouldn't let them in because the transfer did not seem to have worked so they told him to go to the box office, but he got all the way onto the back end of the line to do it again I sent them to the show a half an hour early, but now it was Showtime I got on my bike in the rain to go down there to meet them and got them to the box office.  I showed them my proof of purchase. I showed them the effort to transfer them on the app. I showed them that the app showed it wasn't claimed, but then I showed them that it hadn't shown up on my brother's phone.  And the kid behind the desk said yeah there's nothing I can do.  You have to go over to Ticketmaster at number one.  So we stood in another line I kept saying isn't there a house manager who can put these boys in their seats? It's a school fundraiser. Nobody else is going to be in the seats. There are still tickets available.  It was like dealing with surly teenagers, blank expressions.  Then the new kid said go to box office number two.  My kids ended up missing half of the show and we only got in because I managed to get the app to reclaim the tickets through a workaround.  What do house managers do? what is the purpose of all these kids sitting behind the glass ticket booth if they can't solve a problem? zero problem at management.",09/28/2024 20:16:10,Cynthia M.,2024-09-28 20:16:10

Yelp,5,"Nice, new, modern arena. The inside is pretty dark, which is kind of cool. The paint is primarily black and dark gray. It kind of reminded me of a space ship. The inside of the arena felt a little smaller than I would have expected. However, holding 19,000 seats it's not really smaller than my home arena.   The women's bathrooms are kind of small although there did seem to be a good number of them. There were only 8 stalls in two of the bathrooms I went into. This isn't really enough for women, but they were clean and I saw people actively cleaning them.   Drinks for the concert I attended where pretty expensive, but it was to be expected. $16 for a single and $26 for a double. $18 for a premium single, $28 for a premium double.

Yelp,5,"You see peculiar things when you go to see the Liberty play at Barclays Center.  Men and women. Boys and girls. Old people (a number of the half-time dancers are seniors!) and young. Straight and gay. Friendly security guards. Movie stars. Sports icons. All sitting side by side.  And what are they doing? Just having a great time. Because a Liberty game is a rarity: a no judgement zone.  They held a 'Unity Night' in August, which I found odd, because every game the Liberty play in Barclays is a unity event.  No profanity. No ugly behavior. I have never seen an inebriated fan. The cursing and inappropriate behavior that has become ubiquitous at other New York professional sporting events does not occur at Liberty games. There isn't even any booing (unless a ref blows a call)!  Everyone is happy to be there, happy to be together. It's just a place to cheer and your team to victory.  And what a team! A New York team that really GETS New Yorkers. A tough team, with attitude, strength and an abundance of talent. A team consisting of players who pick one another up. A team that has yet to win a championship (but not, I am certain, for long).  And the place literally rocks. At times you would swear the building was shaking, especially when a Liberty player sinks a 3-pointer in a close game with little time remaining, then excitedly waves a victorious fist, exhorting the crowd as she runs down court.  Everyone standing and screaming deliriously at the top of their lungs in response.  That is when the arena starts spinning and the roof comes off and everyone is lifted up simultaneously, almost to the clouds.",09/10/2024 02:20:36,Philip Z.,2024-09-10 02:20:36

Food of course is overpriced. The tickets were also overpriced and the stage set up obstructed higher views. Limited space to stand and very steep. I'd rather fly out and go to a different basketball venue since it was so cramped with many problems.

Yelp,1,"Went to Nicki Minaj concert in May, lines outside were chaotic and disorganized. Once inside, ushers kept seating us incorrectly, despite the seats clearly marked, and one gave me attitude. concession overpriced, seats very cramped, feeling like you will fall over in to row in front of you.  Everyone smoking weed in their seats, I'm pro weed but it's a little much. Nothing really redeeming about the venu.

Yelp,2,"Hi, I attended the NY Liberty game last night, Monday 5/20. I was seated in section 230. First off, I was deeply disappointed in the fact of it was only two concession options available on the 2nd floor. I decided on Nathan's, and I might as well have put on an employee name tag. Basically, I did everything from gathering the food to checking it out in ( I guess new) check out system.  Yet that same system had the Audacity to have a tip option appear on the screen as though I had been served. To than bite into what was clearly not a Nathan hot dog as well as a stale bun. My friend had the nachos and said he would have been better off putting cheese on an office depot box. It's totally unacceptable and outrageous considering the price point. 7 dollars for a bottle of water that you clearly got the water from the tap. You guys got a real racket going, and as a consumer, I want you to know it's disgusting....fix it!",05/21/2024 09:34:18,Nathan J.,2024-05-21 09:34:18

Finally get inside almost two hours after 7 and the security didn't know how to tell us to get to our seats. No Bathroom near front row had to climb a mountain everytime had to go to bathroom . There was no difference in cheap seats to expensive. If u want to be bullied or feel unsafe going to the bathroom or concession go to Barclay . Security was no good!

I was way to focus on my son & feeling overwhelmed with joy. This is probably one of my proudest moments in life, I am glad after all we had been through I got to see this day & he got to graduate with honors !   As a student government President he was seating on the stage & looking at him up there my eyes were getting foggy with tears. This kid went through a lot as a kid, there was a time I thought it will never come but it did. I am gonna stop now, time to review this place lol..!   This place is huge, lots of exit. Obviously crowded. We were lucky that my parents were here to visit this place & experience this proudest moments with us. They loved it. My mom keeps saying can't believe how organized & clean this place is. The country we are from she doesn't get to see this type of stadiums!   The security in the front could be better organized but I don't blame them ! They are overwhelmed & tired probably. It's not easy to work on a place like this.   Maybe one day I will come back to watch a game or concert. Then I will be able to fully enjoy this place. I was just too busy with the graduation",05/04/2024 16:42:57,Rezwana N.,2024-05-04 16:42:57
Yelp,1,"Attention: JEFF GEWIRTZ - STOP AAPI hate at Barclay Center!   JOEL LEVY, AGM, told me to reach out to you.    I'm Taiwanese American.  Went to a Lakers Nets game yesterday with my daughter.  At the end of the game with less than 5 minutes left, descended down to the lower level to exit and stood behind seats watching the final couple minutes along with 15 other fans.  One female Barclay usher told everyone that as long as we stand behind seats we are good.  3 minutes later, another male usher comes back and says everyone needs to leave.  He then comes only to my daughter and me out of the entire other group of fans (none of whom were Asian American) and up to my face asking   ""DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?""  Joel was right there and all he said was the employee apologized - NO HE DIDN'T.   Racist and discriminatory comments should not be tolerated.    JOE TSAI - DO BETTER and perhaps ensure that even folks (including my 12 year old daughter) of the same descent as you are not being subjected to and protected from conditions based on their race and national origin.  Appalling, disappointing and should not be tolerated.  Didn't pay hundreds of dollars to be treated like trash.  STOP AAPI hate.  Sorry but no longer think highly of you.

Yelp,2,"Went for Sixers nets game. 'Security' is extremely rude. Even when in your section if you're invited up to see players and coaches during shoot around and are having conversation not bothering anyone they threaten to call security to throw you out. No one is even there yet and you're dampening the fan experience. I'm specifically talking about the lady at the bottom of section 115 while I was getting an autograph with one of the players with some other fans she tried to get my fiancé kicked out for waiting for me at the end of the aisle. Literally 100 people total in the building at the time. Very disheartening. Meanwhile, in section 115 people were seat hopping all over the place and not sitting in the seats they bought and no one batted an eye. Maybe should tighten up security there and leave the people alone who paid to be in the section who just want to get a closer look at their favorite players",03/06/2024 04:22:47,Jen F.,2024-03-06 04:22:47

Yelp,4,"Surprise trip to NY included a trip to Brooklyn to catch the Nets play. I know when you think of NYC you think of Madison Square Garden but let me tell you the Barclay's Center did not disappoint! Who knew you could purchase tickets that grants you access to a separate entrance (my friend and thank goodness he did lol). We entered at the Qatar Airways Entrance right next to the AMEX entrance. Yes, if you're an AMEX cardholder they have an entrance just for us! They offer complimentary drinks and give you 10% off if you choose to use your card at the concessions.   Upon entering we went upstairs to Suite Level A, where we were greeted with a few friendly faces. They asked for our tickets and then we were given wristbands. The wristband gave us access to the 40/40 Club (If you're thinking Jay-Z you're right lol). All you can eat food was included in the ticket price and I have to admit they provide a smorgasbord of food. There literally was something available for every type of eater you can think of. You also don't have to worry about standing in long lines to purchase your drinks, as there is a fully stocked bar on this level with friendly bartenders. I can't remember the young man's name, but he was funny and was most definitely pouring drinks lol.   After experiencing this level of exclusivity at an NBA game it will be very hard for me to go to a game and just sit in the ""regular seats"" paying for overpriced concession stand food and drinks. From now on I need a wristband and access to the Suite Level :).",02/22/2024 16:35:59,Domonique S.,2024-02-22 16:35:59
Yelp,2,"I've been here a number of times now for concerts, and I have to say, each experience was killing me a little more inside. The staff, specifically the security leading us inside,  do not know what they are doing. There were three of them giving people different instructions. Who were we supposed to listen to?  My latest visit was for a Chinese concert, Joker Xue, over the weekend. The concert was supposed to start at 8 pm, but by then, 80% of the fans were still standing outside in the cold, waiting to get inside the building. They were not utilizing the other entrances until 8:00 PM sharp. That is ridiculous. So many people missed the beginning of the show despite arriving early, like my husband and I. They were extremely disorganized, and that is very disrespectful to both the performer and the fans.  After finally getting inside, they were giving out the light sticks inside. But despite entering from the entrance directly in front of one of the staff handing them out, he said, ""No, where did you come from? I'm not giving this to you. Go around the building. They are handing it out by other entrances."" What the hell is that?",02/21/2024 14:50:36,Betty Y.,2024-02-21 14:50:36

Yelp,2,"Barclays Center is a soulless pretentious arena that does little to respect the customer. It's like a very bad image using filters to clean up it's poor picture quality. From its inception this George Foreman grill like structure has bullied it's way into the Brooklyn landscape laying waste to neighborhood buildings and businesses.  It has carried it's obnoxiousness into the way it treats customers and patrons of this lackluster arena. I like many other Brooklynites were initially excited to have an arena where we can comfortably travel to, enjoy and return home in a matter of minutes. However, upon opening Barclays has revealed itself as nothing but a money grab pickpocket lacking in charm and beauty as opposed to the Kings Theater also in Brooklyn.   Barclays was designed like a modern American airbus. Take your money, give you little as possible, get you in and get you out as soon as possible. I recently stopped by the box office to purchase tickets to a Nets game. I have never have felt so unwelcomed! I knock on the locked door and a security guard rudely questions why I was there. I asked if this was the box office and she says ""yeah"" and reluctantly lets me in.  I had to go through a metal detector and offload all my belongings before even getting to the window to even buy the tickets!  Don't understand why since the place appeared empty with the exception of the rude guard and three people behind the desk. Two of which were having a conversation and looked up at me and then looked away and continued their conversation. The third ticket salesperson had a friendlier demeanor so I purchased the tickets from her. She was really helpful and assisted me in choosing great seats. If it hadn't been for the tickets being a gift for my son's birthday and the help I needed choosing the seating, I wouldn't have bothered stepping foot in there! Sometimes buying online doesn't give you a true depiction of the seating or space and a real tangible salesperson can assist you much better.   The arena on GameDay wasn't as terrible as I remembered it. I was there for the 1st Nets game ever played there and used to go frequently to Nets games and other events from music concerts to wrestling events. The concessions however are still abysmal and has poor traffic flow unlike MSG. You have a sardine in a can feeling traversing the hallways in search of food. The food options are quite limited for sporting events and you have to decide beforehand to either get food before the event or just miss half of the event waiting online to buy food. Then also shuffling through a crowd to get back to your seat. Take a wrong turn in Barclays and their is an obnoxious air of exclusivity by staff if you mistakenly  wander into the section for luxury boxes. Buying merch at Barclays for a Nets game is the same as purchasing food. Get it before the game, don't get it at all or miss the entire game trying to give them more of your money. Barclays doesn't make it convenient to do anything there. They just want you to shut up, give them your money and get the F out!",01/26/2024 23:58:33,Wayfit L.,2024-01-26 23:58:33

Now the lady with braids already seemed she was not having a good day. She tells me I had to throw it away with saying I can leave it somewhere to pick later. I don’t understand there is an issue but it ok. She does not give clear instructions she was already loud and rude. I asked again can I leave it somewhere to pick up she said yes check it in I asked my sister to check as she crossed over. She yelled you can not do that needs to go to scanner I said no problem the she said you have to throw it away I said the ice I use it as my iron is low to chew. So if checked in and I feel unwell my sister can grab ice for me to chew. I mean no area to get ice without being on line. So I tossed the ice out and everyone saw and then a short black female told her more than once don’t argue she just kept being unprofessional. To a point I asked are you ok. She yelled at me to empty my pockets I said nothing is there she already yelled one at time no one did anything. Well I cross over. A tall black man with dreads was listening for a bit. The short black lady lies and says these two have an nasty attitude. Which wasn’t true cause my sister didn’t even talk. She just looked fyi the other lines not moving. Once we was with the tall black guy with dreads very nice guy. He said sorry we explained what happened I said look at the camera. Now  when I get to my seats the girl next to me a is like me and got hot slight faint thank goodness I carry ice packs which I put on her now if I had my ice medical team and a wheel chair would not be necessary . I think you guys need to figure out things for people who need certain things for a G-D forbid situation. We are human some can not take much heat some may have other situations. There is no reason to be that nasty and to lie be disrespectful  they don’t know everyone’s health issues.

Hello, we were here when we visited New York.

That was my first live basketball game and even though I don't really like basketball, I actually really enjoyed it here.

We had a lot of fun here.

It was definitely worth it.

Met some cool people and managed to get a truly sick spot. It was a night I’ll never forget.

Oh, and another thing is that this place can be a disaster to get out of after a full capacity event, so if you’re planning on coming here, definitely know which train you’re getting back on when the event is done. To be honest, I’d even leave the event early if you can. The subway and main lobby area get packed.",11/08/2025 17:13:58,Minespidur,2025-11-08 17:13:58

Upper tiers are a bit ""nosebleedy"" recommend sitting as low as possible in the 200's for a concert.
Have been to 2 shows here this season and the sound was great for the main acts, but WAY too loud for both openers, cacophonous even from the concessions. (Not just noisy, but NOISE, which felt like poor sound-mixing)
Merch was not as readily available in all areas, (I think it's in one or 2 dedicated spots), which was helpful for not having ridiculous lines through walking areas, but also made it hard to actually shop for band merchandise.
Also Parking in this area is a pain.

I had two seats for my friend and I in section 211. The first bad thing is when people needed to pass me there was very little room for them to pass. The rows are to narrow. I am 5'8"" 160lb male. If I was fat or if a person was fat who wanted to get to there seat I don't see how they will get though. The most annoying thing was people climbing stairs to get to there seats. I missed almost half the game because people were going to there seats during the game. I have been to other arenas and stadiums where there will not let you go to your seat until there is a break in the action. If you like going to a game where you are going to miss half the game because people are blocking your view this is the place for you.",11/03/2025 16:45:33,mhbbej1,2025-11-03 16:45:33

The upper bowl seats are not as great for sound and you can't see much from most of them.

There isn't much leg room so I kind of get what they were saying.

How can someone know that every bag line has a small bag line and a no bag line also.and whats the difference  between small and not small.no one knows. My string bag was to big for a small bag,but a shopping bag that were bigger than my string bag was OK as a small bag.then because no one knows there's those lines within the bag lines.no one goes there,so instead of doing 2 bag lines within the bag line.the other line is completely unused and security standing there doing absolutely nothing while the other line going so slowly you couldnt say it if it's going at all .

Google,5,"Barclays Center is one of those venues that truly captures the energy of New York. Whether it’s a concert, a basketball game, or a special event, the atmosphere is always electric. The design of the arena is modern and impressive, with great lighting, comfortable seating, and good visibility from almost every angle.

Getting in and out is usually smooth, and the location in downtown Brooklyn makes it easy to reach by subway or car. There’s plenty to do nearby—restaurants, bars, and shops—so you can make an evening out of it.

The sound quality inside the arena is excellent, especially for live shows, and the big screens make sure you don’t miss a single moment. Food and drinks are what you’d expect from a large venue—on the pricey side—but the selection is good, with a mix of local favorites and typical stadium classics. Staff are professional, friendly, and keep things running efficiently even when the place is packed.

Overall, Barclays Center delivers the full New York event experience: bold, lively, and unforgettable. It’s big enough to host major acts yet still feels connected and well-run. If you’re visiting the city or live nearby, catching a Tame Impala show or a Nets game here is absolutely worth it.",10/28/2025 22:24:24,Nathalie De Clercq,2025-10-28 22:24:24
