GoNets,How the Nets offense SHOULD work (LONG post with lots of video),"Hey ya'll, I wrote this up because I finally figured out how to make gif/streamable things. I like Kenny Atkinson's offense and its roots, but the Nets just haven't figured it out yet. I definitely think the system good for the future when the Nets actually get NBA players. This is reposted from my [blog thing](https://ignisyon.wordpress.com/2017/01/23/kenny-atkinson-offense-1-23/) and formatted for reddit. This is the first long writing on the Nets I've done ever. Yes, it's long. It's a good poop read. Hope you guys learn something from this

**How Kenny Atkinson has built a modern offense for the Brooklyn Nets, now and for the future**

The Brooklyn Nets are in flux. By rebuilding, the Nets are not just signing new players and staff. The entire franchise is changing. The players, head coach, and GM are the most noticeable changes, but the makeover of the franchise runs deeper. Sean Marks and Kenny Atkinson have referred to the current Nets as a “program.” In college basketball, Coach K and the Duke Blue Devils are a program. So are Rick Pitino and Louisville, Roy Williams and UNC, Jay Wright and Villanova, and many others. But under the Nets’ program, there likely are less shady under the table deals than in men’s college basketball. In the NBA, the San Antonio Spurs are the “program,” which is Sean Marks’ source for branding the Nets as such. This is year one of the new Brooklyn Nets program. Kenny Atkinson is trying to install and teach a complicated motion offense, so there obviously have been growing pains. The record shows that.

In Kenny Atkinson, Sean Marks hired a grandchild of the Gregg Popovich coaching tree, and a child of the Mike D’Antoni tree. There’s probably some weird coaching tree incest thing going on there. Atkinson has adopted principles of the Hawks offense with the Nets, with a few D’Antoni-style philosophical strategies. The offense is the fastest paced in the league, and while it has not led to success for the Nets,  it has kept them competitive. In a team devoid of stars and sheer talent, the offense attempts to put players in situations to succeed. It’s a breath of fresh air, compared to when Lionel Hollins would run Deron Williams off the ball, and have players take turns on stagnant isolation plays. The Nets are finally modern.


**The Offense - Philosophy and Roots**

The Nets offense this season is complex. So here’s way too much information on a team that hasn’t been successful. Kenny Atkinson took the skeleton of the Hawks “Spurs East” offense, and injected it with D’Antoni style speed. It’s pace and space meets Spurs-esque motion. I’d love to think of a cool name for the offensive system, but I think winning has to come first before doing that. With the Hawks sets, the players often did not run any set plays. The system relies on the ability of the players to read and react to the opposing defense. The five players on the floor read when to screen, cut, pass, or attack, and know where to find each other during all the movement. It takes a lot of teamwork. For the Spurs, that teamwork is part of their culture. The Hawks finished their season 6 games under .500 when Mike Budenholzer took over. The offense takes time to learn and build chemistry.

In the Nets current offensive system, there really are no set plays in half court sets, just options. The D’Antoni philosophy comes into play in transition, affecting the team's shot selection and clock control. Shots can come freely from all around the perimeter early in the shot clock, almost as soon as a player crosses the sideline hash mark. The Nets will also use dribble drives to the rim to set up open shooters or find cutters as well. This still leaves room for Brook Lopez post-ups, and Kilpatrick or Bogdanovic creating their own shots off the bounce. Anyone can be a ball handler and initiate the matchup, depending on the matchup. Atkinson said earlier in the season that if a player has a good look at the basket, he should [shoot his shot.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YWaN-SHuS3M/hqdefault.jpg)

Additionally, the Nets offense borrows from the Daryl Morey-Houston Rockets style of shot selection. They take plenty of threes, try to get layups and floaters in the paint, and try to get to the free throw line. The mid range shot may not be completely taboo, but the most efficient shots come from the perimeter and in the paint.


**Strong and Weak Sets**

The Nets run most (probably about 70%) of their offense starting with the “Strong” and “Weak” sets. These two sets come from Popovich and the Spurs, and were the foundation pieces of the Hawks offense. Both of these sets use a four out, one in initial setup, involving movement of the ball from side-to-side, followed by additional action. In Strong, a guard initiates the action by dribbling to a side with a big at the top of the key and another wing on the opposite side. The other big is on the block, with the fifth player, usually a shooter, in the opposite corner, where the ball starts moving (the strong side.)
[Strong positioning](https://i.imgur.com/hIue93k.jpg)

The Weak set has a similar side-to-side movement to start a posession, but instead of the corner wing on the same side as where the ball starts, he’s in the opposite corner, or the weak side. The ballhandler that initiates the play is usually the point guard.
[Weak positioning](https://i.imgur.com/HQbBKVo.jpg)
 
The ball is swung from the primary ball handler, to the opposite side. From here, there are different ways to attack, and it’s up to the players to read the defense. This wing can look to dump it down low to the big to get a post-up or slip for a layup. The Hawks do this [here, in their Strong set.](https://gfycat.com/EnergeticGraveGemsbok)
  
This is a favorite entry point for a Brook Lopez post up. In previous years, Lopez had difficulty even getting position for post ups, starting to back down a few feet inside the three point line. Lopez or Booker can usually get the ball right on the block if they ask for the ball coming out of a Strong or Weak side set. The post pass can come early in the shot clock, allowing enough time for additional movement or a reset.

If the big can’t find proper position for a clear entry pass, the wing in the opposite corner can curl off of a double stagger screen to the top of the three-point line. From here, the wing that receives the ball can shoot it quickly or attack off the dribble. Atlanta had Kyle Korver running off this action, usually. [Korver could come off the double screen for a three at the top of the arc.](https://gfycat.com/GregariousActiveGemsbuck)

[Or he could continue moving on the dribble, looking for his own shot...](https://gfycat.com/DeterminedAgreeableAnnelid)
 
[...or finding an open teammate diving to the basket.](https://gfycat.com/MammothOldHalicore)
 
For the Nets, Joe Harris, when he starts, is usually the wing in the strong side corner. Similar to Korver, Harris comes off of screens hard. He usually opts to take the ball off the dribble for in-between shots, rather than shooting it right off the catch.

If that doesn’t work, the current ballhandler can initiate another set. Atlanta used the play horns as the secondary action off the initial play, and that leaves even more options for scoring. It could lead to a give and go with one of the big men at the elbow, an open shot or drive to the rim by the big or finding another teammate coming off an offball screen. From there, more motion can be initiated, and again, it’s up to the team to read and react to what the defense does. [They can run horns into a give and go...]

[...or cut more to get a shooter to come off of a curl screen.]

The Nets run strong in the following play, with Bogdanovic coming off a second double stagger screen. Dinwiddie cuts from the strong side on the initial action. [It leads to an open, but missed Trevor Booker three point shot in the corner.](http://streamable.com/m1b8z)

The Nets run a modification of the Strong set, and instead of running horns, [Bogdanovic uses Booker as a screener in the pinch post, leading to a Lopez open three.](http://streamable.com/hu4jy)

[Here, the Strong set swings the ball back across the court, where Dinwiddie recognizes the double and passes it to Lopez, who gets into the lane for a floater.](http://streamable.com/yehg2)

If the ball can’t be moved to the other side on the initial action, the corner player can come over and receive a handoff. Here, Kilpatrick is being denied the pass by Kidd-Gilchrist. [Booker hands it off to Bogdanovic, coming off a Dinwiddie screen, and forces a rushed pass after getting a quick double.](http://streamable.com/t4z4c)

[In this set, Kemba Walker denies the ball from Dinwiddie on the swing. This leads to Kilpatrick coming off a LeVert stagger screen, and he uses Booker as a pick and roll partner.](http://streamable.com/jnnkm)

The Weak set is similar to Strong, but can be used to get the point guard a good look, whereas Strong can be used for a wing player. In Weak, instead of the corner wing coming off a double stagger screen, the initial ballhandler comes off a screen, and can go to work from there. Jeff Teague was usually the guy doing this in Atlanta. His speed off of a screen from a big allowed him to initiate the offense, and create for himself or for his teammates.

[The Nets run “Weak” here, leading to a Randy Foye three early in shot clock. Kilpatrick, who brought the ball up, comes off of a screen by Acy.](http://streamable.com/y9g82)

[In this set, Whitehead comes off of an RHJ screen and gets the pass. He dumps it to RHJ, and Bogdanovic comes across on a double stagger screen. Ball movement leads to an open Lopez 3.](http://streamable.com/anunb)

[In this variation, Whitehead sets the weak side screen to get Bogdanovic open at the elbow. The ball is swung for a Foye three point shot.](http://streamable.com/bxorj)

[Here, the Weak side set leads to an Isaiah Whitehead-Quincy Acy pick and roll, with Acy forcing up a contested shot.](http://streamable.com/87gng)

After the initial screen action, the ball can be handed off to the screener, who can take it off the dribble. [Gustavo Ayon does that here.](https://gfycat.com/SleepyRegularKrill) Lopez does this sometimes for the Nets, and he can dribble to the rim or post up.

Atkinson has added his own flair to the Hawks offense by speeding things up and looking for early offense. The initial ball reversal can be done right as the players cross half court. Before the shot clock even reaches :20, the team may already have fired a shot from the perimeter, or found a big down low. This occasionally allows for an easy bucket or a quick switch, with the defense not really set coming off of their own offensive possession.


**Inbound Plays and Horns**

The Nets offense doesn’t run Strong and Weak sets every play. A common set in the NBA is Horns. The ball handler is met with the two bigs at the elbows, and the ball handler can initiate a pick and roll, drive, or set up more movement by passing it to a big in a triangle offense pinch post. There are a lot of (maybe endless) options coming out of Horns. [Caris LeVert uses Horns to set up a pick and pop for an open Quincy Acy three.](https://streamable.com/w38pk/)

[LeVert initiates horns again, with RHJ slipping the screen, and the defender Frank Kaminsky icing the ball handler. The rotation leaves Foye open in the corner for three.](http://streamable.com/otkko)

The Nets have had a lot of success coming out of time outs, which has been noticed by the YES crew. Atkinson seems to excel at inbounds play calls. Even if the players miss, they usually get a clean look or drive to the basket. [In this play, Kilpatrick comes off of a rip screen from Lopez to initiate a pick and roll right at the free throw line.](http://streamable.com/ibncb)

[Another inbounds play has Michael Kidd-Gilchrist fighting two stagger screens from Booker and Lopez, leading to an open Kilpatrick three.](http://streamable.com/aeupd)


**Drives, PNR, and Swings**

This is where the fast pace and D’Antoni style comes in. At any point in the offense, the players on the perimeter can come off the dribble and attack. While this may not always lead to an easy layup, it causes the defense to scramble, and may leave someone open on the perimeter for a three, drive or additional ball reversal. RHJ, in recent games, has been attacking the basket well, usually leading to him getting to the rim. Coming out of weak action, RHJ drives against Frank Kaminsky. This causes a rotation to the rim. [RHJ dumps it off to Acy, who swings it to Bogdanovic for three.](http://streamable.com/ji1ls)

[Ball reversal early in the shot clock allows Kilpatrick to drive to the basket and find Bogdanovic for the open three here.](http://streamable.com/6itr4)

Out of strong, weak or horns, pick and roll, or pick and pop can be initiated. There are some plays where the Nets run the pick and roll to start the possession. [Here, Whitehead finds Acy for an easy layup when Cody Zeller doubles the ballhandler.](http://streamable.com/bn79s)

[Dinwiddie denies the screen from Lopez, but Charlotte doubles on the drive again, and Dinwiddie finds a diving Lopez for the floater.](http://streamable.com/2soiz)


**Transition, Post-ups, and Isolation**

The Nets offense is so fast, that it seems like they’re always on a fast break. Zach Lowe of ESPN and Kevin O’Connor of the Ringer have commented on the occasional effectiveness of [the Trevor Booker coast to coast.](http://streamable.com/hihf7)

Atkinson has encouraged guys to push the ball. Any player (other than the centers) can bring the ball up the court and initiate the offense, or drive to the basket if the defense is napping. This is by design, as the offense hasn’t really used a dominant ballhandler.

The Brook Lopez post up can also set up the offense. Coming off an entry pass, Lopez can start backing down his defender. The entry passer can cut away from the basket and set a screen for another wing along the top of the three-point line. If Lopez faces up, there usually are shooters at the weak side wing and at the weak side elbow. Lopez has also shown an ability to find cutters that dive to the basket after an entry pass or down screen. The Spurs ran similar action with Tim Duncan, and are still doing so with LaMarcus Aldridge.

Sean Kilpatrick and Bojan Bogdanovic are the two players that use simple isolation the most. This may not be part of the motion offense, but it has been successful for both at some points. Kilpatrick does a decent job at using dribble moves to get to the rim or create enough space for a shot. Bogdanovic uses the threat of his three point shot to get defenses to decide on whether to stay on him, where he can use long strides to get past the defender, or make a sagging defender pay by shooting a jumper with space.


**So, is the offense any good?**

Considering the personnel the Nets have, the motion x pace and space system can really maximize players’ strengths, and put players in positions to succeed. The speed of the offense can catch defenses not paying attention, or can take advantage of mismatches early in the shot clock. The motion offense, in theory, makes everyone an offensive threat. There is less standing around and more movement to work for an open shot. The offense is not just about cutting to find an open shooter, contrary to what some may think. In a season where star power has never been more evident, the Nets have been competitive in games without having a fair counter to the likes of Harden, DeRozan, Curry and Durant. With the constant motion, the players have to read and attack.

For the future, I think that Kenny Atkinson’s offense can be successful, given the personnel. The Hawks won 60 games with the same offense. While they may not have gone to the NBA Finals, they shocked the league by being super-successful without having a bonafide megastar. With the NBA becoming longer and more athletic, a motion offense can create mismatches off of screen action, or draw defenders far enough to leave someone open. It keeps everyone on the court involved, with a lot of offensive possessions having all five players touch the ball. It is a far cry from the pounding of the basketball for 18 seconds, and a contested midrange shot with 6 seconds left on the shot clock. Nets fans are familiar with that.

That all sounds great, right? Ball movement, open shots, drives to the rim, and sharing really has caused the team to overcome their talent disparity, right? Obviously, it hasn't. An innovative, team-oriented system, adapted from two successful philosophies has had no major effect on the wins-loss column this season for Brooklyn. There are different scapegoats in the Nets’ current standing as a bottom dweller, in the standings and on the stat sheets. Obviously, Billy King is at the top of that list for the Nets’ current position. But on the court, the offense isn't always as smooth as described here. By trying to emulate the Hawks and Spurs, the Nets have a clear goal of the style they want. But with the current roster, there are some things to work on. I’ll be covering how the Nets offense can and has gone wrong this season in my next post.

My entire knowledge of the Hawks offense comes from an amazing reddit post, which definitely did not get enough love. I used a few of the poster's gifs to show how the Hawks used Strong, Weak, and Horns sets to generate their offense. He goes into much deeper detail and really delves into every option that can occur in the offensive system.

GoNets,I have a cool story about Spencer Dinwiddie that I haven't shared before!,"What up y'all. Outside of Spencer, I can't claim to be a Nets fan at all. Raised in Colorado and always rooted for my Buffs and Nuggets... anyway. I have a neat little story about the type of dude Spencer is that I thought you guys may appreciate.  
  
As a kid in high school I was quite the loner, but the one thing that I always found friends through was basketball. Going to CU games and watching Spencer was my favorite thing, and I have fond memories of sprinting through snow in shorts and a t-shirt from the free parking ~2 miles away up to Coors Event Center with my friends.  
  
From the day he committed and I saw his highlights and interviews, he was my favorite player. I think he plays smarter, and has better basketball IQ, than any other PG out there - to me the best basketball to watch is clean and calculated. At this time, being the weird, out-of-place kid I was, I also friended all the CU basketball and football players on Facebook. Dunno why, just thought it was cool at the time.  
  
For Christmas my sophomore year, all I really wanted was a #25 CU jersey. My parents told me they looked everywhere but couldn't find one. In my desperation, I turned directly to Spencer for help. Here was the convo: https://i.imgur.com/mIcxfCH.png  
  
Years go by and, sure enough, as I boldly predicted (he was a college soph. at the time of original message, and would go on to miss half his junior year with a torn ACL), Spencer winds up in the NBA. First bouncing around with the Pistons as you guys know after yesterday, then the Bulls, finally sticking with the Nets. One day I found the old convo and decided to shoot it his way on Instagram: https://imgur.com/a/I3Umk8a  
  
And The Mayor fucking pulled through! He sent a Nets jersey out, and it arrived just in time for Christmas of last year, 5 Christmases after I was unable to get the jersey of his I had longed for. I was giddy, had no idea how to thank him, but it absolutely made my holiday. His jersey (and signature) are now proudly displayed on the wall of my apartment, and I have such a cool backstory to share with them! https://imgur.com/a/YnWAl0o  
  
**Tl;dr young, stupid highschool me couldn't get my hands on Spencer's jersey when he played at CU, he said he'd get me one once in the NBA someday, and made good on that promise 5 full years later.**",696,49,2018-11-02,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/9tf8nq/i_have_a_cool_story_about_spencer_dinwiddie_that/

GoNets,I'm incredibly depressed (re-Kyrie and team generally),"Long-time Nets fan since the J-Kidd days (and a Jewish American). Man, I don't even know what to do about everything going on with the team -- and everything since Irving got here.

I was at the game last night and anxious to go with all of the garbage he was tweeting out. And then to watch the team play with such little energy (with the exception of my guys Joey Buckets). It's just utterly disheartening.

Even worse is seeing some folks (not here) spinning some of his words as fine and defending it. I'm definitely not saying NBA players have to always be perfect but Kyrie's constant doubling down of conspiracy nonsense has not only hurt the fanbase (I have multiple friends who won't go a Nets game until he's gone) but also has hurt the team itself.

Wondering how long this can all go on for. I truly long for the days of not only Kenny and the younger team, but J-Kidd. Just a team to be proud of instead of this mess. Even Cam and the other rookies are leaving me sour.

Just a feeling of blow it all up and start over - it feels way too far gone. And to me the key link of a lot of it has been Kyrie.",521,276,2022-10-30,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/yhcspk/im_incredibly_depressed_rekyrie_and_team_generally/

GoNets,"Our team is so likeable now, that this turned into every others team secondary sub","It's cool that they like us, especially the Suns since every other post here is from them, but can this stay a Brooklyn Nets sub? 

I got Suns fans in my DMs trolling me for saying trade ain't gonna happen a year ago. I don't need them here now talking about the twins and how great they are.

This is no Mikal and Cam Johnson sub for the Suns, this is supposed to be a Nets sub for Nets fans. Can it please be like that?",382,148,2023-02-12,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/110ej9d/our_team_is_so_likeable_now_that_this_turned_into/

GoNets,"Don't let anyone take this away from you, not one bit","I've read countless variations of the Nets can't sell tickets, the Nets aren't real NY, the Nets bought their championship, or the Nets don't have a real fan base. It's all bullshit and it's all a ploy to get clicks and views. We knew this would happen. No one said shit when we were scrappy underdogs, but now that we're on the top of the mountain people will say anything to drop us down a peg. Fuck 'em. We earned our place here and now that it's the playoffs, we don't give a shit what's going on across the river or anywhere else, unless we face them. 

The Nets are *our* team. Not the media's. Not the city's. And not the haters. We want a championship and have built towards this for almost 5 years. Anyone can dismiss this team however they choose, but the reality is the goal of a title and no matter what happens throughout the playoffs, that's all we'll be hearing starting tomorrow night.",375,84,2021-05-21,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/nhqw7e/dont_let_anyone_take_this_away_from_you_not_one/

GoNets,"if you aren't going to ride with us in this rough patch, don't come back for the playoffs","so many defeatist like  post and attitudes over the past 3 games  , saying we're done and what not.  bros,  in the words of Dutch from red dead,  ""Have some GOD DAMN FAITH ""

we have a 86 % chance at playoffs  with the magic and heat needing an amazing finish  to get over us in playoffs. including a game with us (heat) .  we have the tie breaker over the magic as well.  

so tell me? why so many of you guys losing faith? this is LITERALLY the same nets team we been watching all year.  

believe in brooklyn yall.  otherwise dont come back in the post season,  this is a ride or die team

this is our first playoff series in 4-5 years with a young team. why are you quitting with 7 mins on the clock while the ""main unit"" is still on floor.   did you not learn anything this season?

we should NEVER have an audible  "" trust the process "" chant at home ever again.  if you are going to quit on the team at barclays, stay the fuck home or give your tickets to a real diehard. save that bs  for regular season if needed, not in the postseason.   either ride and die with us or just hop the ride now.",247,66,2019-04-19,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/bf0kwa/to_the_fans_who_left_early_last_night_dont_come/
GoNets,"Kevin Durant on the Brooklyn Nets: “I want to see this franchise do well. What’s it 12-13 picks they got?… When you look at the big picture, you’ve got young guys getting experience, you’re building assets and getting future picks. Hopefully, you can draft up and put the team together well.""",,242,60,2025-01-23,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1i7q8uo/kevin_durant_on_the_brooklyn_nets_i_want_to_see/
GoNets,How is it possible that Nets fans are already spoiled?,"A team that wasn't supposed to come close to making the playoffs is down 2-1 and 80% of this sub is whining/complaining/firing people. 

Young teams almost always struggle in first playoff series. The Nets are learning about playoff defense and intensity - you can't take possessions off on defense in the playoffs. The experience is going serve them really well in the long run. And as a fan, this is fun! We won one game and the two losses included plenty of thrilling moments. 

 If you can't handle losing in the playoffs, go bandwagon GSW. Or go back to rooting for the Knicks - their coach didn't make any mistakes last night.

Edit: I'll put it another way. Let's say Nets lose by 12 tomorrow and are coming off court at home for what is likely the last time  Would you give them a long standing ovation or boo? Because it feels like a lot of this sub would boo.",239,62,2019-04-19,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/beyz8x/how_is_it_possible_that_nets_fans_are_already/

GoNets,Barclays concession workers (not mobile carts) are tipping themselves 30% on every purchase. Watch out next game.,"Hey everyone,

I work at a stadium back in Boston, I am a heavy tipper. All game I was tipping 25% + to every beer cart when I would get beers (friend's B-Day so a few stops at the beer cart) With the mobile devices, they give us the option to tip

Not the concessions stands. 

--

At halftime, we went for food. After the hot dog stand ran out of buns we had to go to the cheese steak stand. Bought two beers and a cheese steak. Total was like $45. On the machine it said either $58 or $59 so I could tell something was up. 
 ---

I asked ""hey why is the total so much higher than the price of it?"" Her colleague said ""TAX ITS TAX"" - so I ask ""OK can I turn the screen so I can tip?"" Immediate response ""No its fine you can just pay. This happened to my friend right after at the same stand - thats when it hit me that the stand was tipping themselves

----

This is not me trying to rat anyone out, like I said I work at a stadium I know people do shady shit - but usually against the company not the customer. So any Nets fans looking to go to a game this year be weary of concessions stands, if they dont turn the screen to let you tip, odds are that they are tipping themselves and doing it heavily.

GoNets,I was there.,"I was there at Brendan Byrne Arena.

I was there when Drazen died.

I was there at Continental Airlines Arena. 

I was there for Gill, Marbury, Kittles, and Van Horn.

I was there for the highest of highs - Kidd and the Finals trips, consistent years of being competitive, and Vinsanity.

I was there at the Izod Center.

I was there for the lowest of lows - 70 losses, mortgaging the future for washed up stars, and more losing seasons.

I was there at the Prudential Center.

I was there at the Barclays Center.

I was there for the rebuild that showed we could compete by developing talent.

I am here now.

F*** the haters. F*** anyone that says us diehards don’t deserve this success. F*** the people saying we’ve bought this opportunity. Most importantly - F*** ANYONE ROOTING AGAINST US. THIS IS OUR F***ING TIME.",215,37,2021-05-21,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/nhz8yi/i_was_there/

GoNets,Good morning Nets Fam,"Seems we keep growing more and more every day. I remember when we had just a tick over 5k in this sub like it was yesterday. We were seen as a laughingstock franchise at the time and now? You know.

&amp;#x200B;

Today everything changes. We don't know exactly how and nothing is definite til pen hits the paper, but everything changes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever we do, let's not take it for granted. Our minds might be a little Kyrie, but our hearts are a lot of Dinwiddie. And Harris. And Caris. And Jarrett. Patience, determination, hard work, and a team-first mentality got us to this point and yes, I say ""us"" because the fans are just as much a part of this. Some a little longer than others, but we've helped build this machine outside of Barclay's just as much as Marks and everyone built it inside. Enjoy this. For as much and as long as possible. The ride's about to get even more crowded and about to move even faster and we can't forget to enjoy it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Brooklyn, for as long as I've lived here, has always been about hustle. The rewards of hustle are always, *always* earned. It doesn't matter what version of Brooklyn you currently live in, or have lived in, the spoils of drive and ambition never change. And now we've seen that play out in front of our eyes. Enjoy it, at least for today.

GoNets,The 2019 NBA draft lottery shows that the Brooklyn Nets made the right decision by not tanking.,"When the 2017-2018 started, there was a lot of noise among Brookyln Nets, for we would finally have our very own first round draft pick since the infamous Brooklyn Nets-Boston Celtics trade that took away all of our draft picks for the foreseeable future. It was expected that tanking would be mentioned and suggested, and it was understandable, who here wouldn´t want to get a chance at the top prospects like the Duke stars, Bol Bol, Hunter, Morant, Culver or any other player?

&amp;#x200B;

The Nets though, didn´t choose the tanking route, instead choosing to fight for a playoff spot with the newly drafted players Rodion Kurucs and Dzanan Muza, as well as with improving players such as Dlo, Caris Levert and Jarett Allen. Our efforts were rewarded with the 6th seed of the Eastern Conference Playoffs, where we unfortunately lost to the Philadelphia 76ers with a tough and heart-breaking five game series, that although dissapointing, did bring a lot of experience for our players and coaches and knowledge for our front office.

&amp;#x200B;

The Nets eventually ended up with the 17th, 27th and 31th picks of this year´s draft, highlighting that the 17th pick, our own, is going to be our highest selection, as long as no trades are realized, since 2010, when the Nets selected Derrick Favors with the 3rd pick. This marks a new era of Brooklyn basketball, not because the team is going to draft a superstar or nothing like that, but because they got their independance back and can now finally decide its own destiny.

&amp;#x200B;

Then again, the tanking questions come back. 17th pick and it is our highest in 9 years? That is a long time, we surely could come back to the lottery with a bang, with one of the league´s worst records and therefore, highest odds to the 1rst pick coudn´t we? Who knows, we might have even seen Zion on a Nets jersey if we won around 16-24 wins right?

&amp;#x200B;

But it doesn´t work like that anymore, the lottery has changed, no longer does the worst team have the best odds to get the 1rst pick, now the odds are almost equally divided between the 4 to 5 worst teams, and the repercussion of this rule change showed yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

The New York Knicks, our biggest rival,  choose the tanking route that was so suggested a year ago, winning only 17 games, the worst record in the NBA. The hype was high for the Knicks fans, Zion pretty much became necessity, the organization became dependant of an asset they didn´t have, the first pick of the draft, that could be used with Williamson or for a potential Anthony Davis trade. Well, the Knicks ended up with the 3rd pick, that doesn´t sound too bad, but it is well known that every player besides Zion in this draft is a consolation prize, and that is what the Knicks are going to get.

&amp;#x200B;

So where does this end for the Nets? Well, I can´t say I know of course, I am not a magician or a time traveler, I am just a 16 year old Brazillian that has been watching this team for no longer than 4 years. What I can say is that by not tanking, we surely avoided many anxieties that come with the constant losing we have all experienced for so long. But what is most important is that, at the end of the day, we didn´t follow the norm, we didn´t just ""tank the hell of it"", hoping for a superstar on the draft that could never come. At the end, we stayed true to ourselves, we fought, and yes, we did ""Go Hard"" as most people would say. We won, we lost, we came back, we ""went front"", if I may invent an expression, our players took an elbow in the face, our team made one of the craziest comebacks of all time, we took bumps and bruises along the way, but at the end we did what many teams that tank and take their fans for granted will never do.

&amp;#x200B;

what does levert have to do to keep yall happy?  last year  yall wanted to chase D'lo out of brooklyn too and now we got kyrie and  what has changed?

GoNets,Don’t be Surprised if we win tonight,"I say we have a 30-40% chance of winning tonight.

Why?

First it will be a neutral court game. The fans won’t be hype at all. It will basically be a neutral court game with a crowd that isn’t really in to it. Probably not until the 4th quarter.

Second the Pacers might not be motivated. Its just natural to not have the same intensity as playing against super stars like KD and Kyrie.

Third we have just enough scoring punch to run a decent offense. Cam, Mills, Sumner and Yuta. 

Fourth the pressure will 100% be on Indiana. The longer the game is close the more tight the Pacers will get. 

Fifth guys like Cam, Duke, Edwards and Sharpe will be extremely motivated. 

If the Nets start off strong I see this game being close. A hot shooting night may result with a win.",132,55,2022-12-10,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/zhzcwp/dont_be_surprised_if_we_win_tonight/
GoNets,[Analysis] Some of the offensive plays the Nets ran last night and other opinions on various topics.,"So Kenny Atkinson came out after the game and said that the Nets pretty much aren't running any plays offensively. However, watching the game...this was false. I don't really get why he decided to say this. Maybe he said this to shift blame onto himself rather than the players? I don't know. Either way, let's run through some of the plays the Nets ran during the game and hopefully you're able to see some of the options that develop over the course of the game.

***Some offensive plays the Nets ran***

**HORNS set plays**

[First play of the game they run a set called HORNS which has two people FT line extended who set on-ball screens on both sides of the ball handler. They give the ball to Prince, who ends up taking a tough fall-away shot after a DJ screen] (https://streamable.com/1xni7)

[Kyrie starts off with the ball, LeVert and DJ are at elbows, and prince/harris are in the corners. Irving passes to Caris who gets a double ball screen set for him by Irving and DJ, but the play goes no where and leads to a turn over.](https://streamable.com/pycc7)

[Irving passes the ball to LeVert at the elbows. LeVert backs it up and Irving sets the screen for him, while JA rolls to the rim. LeVert ends up making the tough shot over Sabonis](https://streamable.com/03l94)

[Play call ATO. Harris sets a screen for LeVert, then ball screens for Irving, dives to the rim. Prince gets open after a DJ screen and makes the three](https://streamable.com/8e2hs)

[Prince fakes the screen and pops, throws a low pass to a diving JA who gets the and-1](https://streamable.com/ypo4m)

[Same play, but instead of Kyrie passing to Prince after he pops, JA sets the screen, Kyrie drives and passes to LeVert. LeVert shakes Lamb on the drive and dumps it off to JA for the dunk.](https://streamable.com/0bhtn)

[Kyrie brings the ball up. Harris (kinda) screens for Kyrie and pops to three, but Kyrie drives to the rim and gets the and-1.](https://streamable.com/0hjqv)

[Dinwiddie brings the ball up with JA and Kurucs at the elbow. He passes it to Kurucs and JA sets a flare screen for Dinwiddie. Kurucs gives Dinwiddie the ball, but he doesn't take the shot, so he goes to a double ball screen. It goes nowhere, the Nets end up taking a bad shot](https://streamable.com/3a5rv)

**Motion Strong**

[Nets run motion strong to start the third for LeVert, having him go through two stagger screens, which produces nothing. Then DJ ball screens for Caris, who passes to Harris. Harris and DJ then run a two-man game for a three that misses.](https://streamable.com/o5ip5)

[Nets run motion strong for Harris, which turns into a double ball screen for Dinwiddie, who passes the ball to Harris who makes the open three.](https://streamable.com/mmnky)

**Misc** 

[Nets run a play that I've seen called swing-down-flip. Dinwiddie swings to DJ. On DJ's left, you have Kurucs set a pindown screen for LeVert, and on the right you have Harris set the flare screen. The initial play doesn't provide a shot, so Dinwiddie runs P&amp;R with DJ, and passes it to Kurucs, who gets a dunk](https://streamable.com/azosb)

[Same concept, Kurucs sets a pindown for LeVert, who drives to the rim and hits a tough shot.](https://streamable.com/krwlp)

[Kyrie inbounds to Kurucs, who hands it back to Kyrie. LeVert cuts to the rim and Harris uses the DJ stagger screen to get open for the three.](https://streamable.com/cd4n2)

[Nets run what's called the Spain P&amp;R, where a screen is set for the ball handler and a third player sets a screen for the roll man. In this case, Dinwiddie gets a screen set by Allen drives, Kyrie sets the screen on Allen's man during his role. The ball makes it's way to Temple, who gets JA a dunk to end the quarter](https://streamable.com/4hi0y)

[JA sets a pindown for Temple and JA sets a flare screen for Kyrie, who misses the open three](https://streamable.com/j96yi)

***Opinions on various topics***

***So, about the offense***

I know the offense has people up and arms right now because it doesn't look pretty at times, but...it's not anything different from what the Nets ran last year. They are ISO'n two more possessions more than they did last year (from 9 to 11), but the structure of the offense is the same. They have their set plays, but they also give certain players the freedom (Dinwiddie, LeVert, Irving) to run isolation plays for themselves. I think the big thing for the team going forward is having back up plans to when initial plays don't work with more P&amp;Rs and off-ball movement than just pure ISOs.

***So, about the defense***

It's weird to see people criticize the drop scheme of the Nets so heavily to start the season. It's a scheme that's deployed regularly around the league. And it's the same exact scheme that the Nets ran last season, a year where they was tied for 14th in DRTG to end the season and were a top 5 defense after January 1st. Is the scheme not in their favor all the time? Yes, players like Kemba destroyed the Nets because of the scheme. But the Nets were still successful with this scheme last season. The reality for the Nets is that the scheme might be perfectly fine, but the current Nets players aren't good enough defensively to make it work. I personally think that the Nets are getting a little unlucky with opponent makes, but the Nets are making errors that are hurting them. 

[TJ Warren passes to Sabonis who hands it back to Warren for the easy layup. Looks like DJ communicates to Prince to get Warren, but he doesn't. Pretty bad](https://streamable.com/039o2)

[LeVert loses TJ Warren off-ball and Warren scores.](https://streamable.com/r1gtn)

[LeVert has a bad turnover and gives good effort to get back in the play, but he goes to Brogdan who Kyrie also picks up, leaving Lamb open. Kyrie ends up getting lost in the scramble and it leads to a Warren make.](https://streamable.com/a71b4)

[DJ and Temple botch a switch off between Sabonis and Lamb, giving him and open three.](https://streamable.com/0e28k)

[Temple helps off TJ MCconnell since David Nwaba falls behind due to the Sabonis screen. Temple retreats to MCconnell, but Nwaba doesn't go back to Brogdan, who airballs a wide open jumper.](https://streamable.com/r3f3q)

[Late in the fourth when the Nets were down they started to trap Brogdan on P&amp;Rs. In this example, he passes it off to Sabonis who drives. Harris and Irving both help and JA returns to the to get a block. Both Harris and Irving don't need to help here, only one of them should. I want to say Irving should of been the one to do it, but I might be wrong.](https://streamable.com/xen51)

***The bench unit sucks, and it might be time to give Dzanan Musa a test run***

Running all bench unit lineups is either feast or famine in the NBA. Right now, it's looking more like famine for the Nets. Dinwiddie is the only real creator on the bench and they surrounded him with basically 4 non-shooters right now. But there is someone the Nets could turn to that *could* help. You know that guy who (allegedly, according to Netsdaily) was ranked #11 on the internal mock draft in 2017, but hasn't played a meaningful NBA game yet? The same guy whose shown in the Euroleague, G-league, and pre-season that he's a capable ball handler and can shoot at a respectable percentage? Maybe the Nets should play that guy. 

David Nwaba and Garrett Temple have provided little to nothing offensively to start the season, particularly Nwaba. Throughout his career, Nwaba has been a non-shooter and doesn't garner respect from other teams offensively. 

[This is the right play by LeVert after the ball screen by Allen, but Nwaba, a career 33% three point shooter, misses the shot.](https://streamable.com/urh34)

[Dinwiddie drives after the ball screen by JA and passes it to Nwaba, who doesn't take the shot. This is good help defense by TJ, but Nwaba still has space to launch it.](https://streamable.com/pooko)

[Temple fakes the ball screen and gets a pindown set by Allen. Dinwiddie uses this opportunity to drive and he passes to the corner for a TO. This falls on Nwaba to me, who had a wide open three, but instead decided to cut.](https://streamable.com/7zmfc)

[The Nets run a HORNS set and Nwaba is spotted up in the corner. But why? Feel like it would be better served to have a floor spacer if you're going to run these sets.](https://streamable.com/3a5rv)

[Temple fakes the ball screen and moves to the weak side corner. Kurucs, knowing the spacing is bad, tells Nwaba to slide over. Dinwiddie drives and throws it out-of-bounds thinking Kurucs would be at his previous spot. Also partial blame to Dinwiddie because he's jumping and trying to pass](https://streamable.com/7pp5x)

[The Nets run a double stagger screen DHO for Nwaba and he turns the ball over attempting a difficult pass. Why run this play for Nwaba of all people? He's not a threat to shoot off of screens, so people will just go under and block his driving lanes.](https://streamable.com/jy0xr)

Nwaba is Treveon Graham 2.0 for the Nets and he isn't going to drastically change this defense. If the Nets are going to continue to be dead weight on defense, why not just go all in on offense? Musa isn't going to solve all their problems with the bench, but as I mentioned earlier, when this team runs all bench-unit lineups, they have two non-shooters (whoever the center is and Nwaba) and a reluctant shooter (Kurucs) next to Dinwiddie. Having someone who can shoot and run P&amp;R next to Dinwiddie might help a little. However, at this moment, with Musa being called and re-called from g-league practice, I'm guessing they don't see him as someone that's ready to play soon. 

***The upcoming games***

Coming into this week I thought there was a realistic chance that the Nets could end the week 1-5. The Pacers have owned the Nets forever and they run a two-big lineup that hurts the Nets. The Rockets are gonna destroy the defense and no one can guard Westbrook or Harden. Then they have DET (both teams on a B2B), which is winnable, but who knows if Blake/Jackson will play and Drummond is gonna walk into a 20-20 game most likely. After these games, the nets schedule isn't pretty: Home vs NOP, road swing featuring @POR, @PHX, @UTH, @DEN and then they come back home for a soft schedule. The next six games will really tell us where this team is and if the panic button is gonna come out. Hopefully it gets better before it gets ugly.

**If people care: I'm not gonna write about the HOU vs. Nets game on friday because it'll just turn into ""No one could guard harden or westbrook"" or ""they made a lot of threes."" Might do a write up for the DET game if I feel like it.**",127,18,2019-10-31,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/dpuec2/analysis_some_of_the_offensive_plays_the_nets_ran/

GoNets,"[Analysis] Jarrett Allen's dominant defensive performance, first impression on Claxton, Atkinson's defensive adjustments, and other notes","**Jarrett Allen's dominant defensive performance**

Yesterday's performance by JA was easily the best this season and it really stood out defensively. It was a great combination of excellent interior defense and effort. To me, it might of been the best performance defensively in his career, though that may be a little reactionary. Either way, he played incredibly well on that end. 

[Dame and Whiteside run a P&amp;R. JA does a good keeping dame in front of him and recovering to Whiteside for the miss](https://streamable.com/qush0)

[Dame goes downhill after a Rodney Hood screen, but JA deflects the pass. Kyrie saves it, but it goes to the Blazers. JA then closes out to two shooters, which results in a miss. Pretty good effort by him](https://streamable.com/o5afz)

[CJ shakes Dinwiddie and drives to the rim to take a difficult shot, but JA gives an excellent contest making it harder](https://streamable.com/78tkc)

[Dame throws to Whiteside and goes, gets the ball back, but JA gets a deflection on the Lillard pass to Shiteside which leads to a steal](https://streamable.com/2fogq)

[Allen gets switched onto CJ near the rim and gets some daylight, but JA blocks him from behind and the Nets get possession](https://streamable.com/jk7tv)

[Allen contests CJ's tough floater attempt, CJ gets the OREB, but Allen gets the back side block.](https://streamable.com/dusms)

[Even though Dame makes this shot, JA doesn't fall for his advance dribbling skills and still gives a good contest.](https://streamable.com/ckscu)

[Cumulative effect of JA's rim protection int he game. CJ could of easily went for a left handed lay up and shielded JA off with his body, but since JA has been a deterring presence in this game, he tries a difficult pass that leads to a TO.](https://streamable.com/fa3te)

[Harris blocks the initial attempt my Mario, he botches the second attempt, and the third is blocked by JA who stays with the play.](https://streamable.com/gj4r8)

[Allen shows on the Whiteside screen and Dame goes downhill, but JA stays in stride with him and gets the block from behind](https://streamable.com/9jlh4)

This was easily JA's best performance this season. It feels like the prevailing opinion on him this season has been that he's struggled. I think that may be true offensively (mostly from the FT line), but defensively he's been perfectly fine. 

**Claxton's first impression**

Coming out of Georgia, Claxton showed flashes as a modern center who can guard perimeter players with his defensive skills and long wingspan. He's always in a stance defensively and he has pretty lateral movement which helps him stay in front of guards. His offensive skills are lagging behind his defensive skills, but he has shown the ability in college to play defacto point guard by bringing up the ball to initiate offense in the half court in P&amp;R or play in transition, but the Nets aren't to ask him to do that. He's also shown the ability to shoot the ball from deep, but based on his percentages (3P and FT) in college, he isn't ready to be a perimeter player right now, but maybe in the future. 

Yesterday game vs. the Blazers was the perfect entry point for Claxton's career. The Blazers are currently riddled with injuries to their best two bigs (Nurkic and Collins), who would of most likely overwhelmed them physically. Instead, he got to play and show out against Labissiere, other smaller lineups, and the always lethargic Whiteside. 

[Claxton's wingspan comes in handy off the Temple miss, allowing him to grab it away from Labissiere](https://streamable.com/hzjf1)

[Claxton gets switched onto CJ, stays with him on the drive, and blocks his shot](https://streamable.com/qnffo)

[He shows good effort by going up for the OREB after the Caris miss to get the and-one opportunity](https://streamable.com/si75j)

[Claxton seemed to struggle on how long to commit to the roll man and CJ here, but CJ forces a tough shot that misses with a good contest from Claxton](https://streamable.com/agx0p)

[Another good contest from Claxton on the Simmon's shot attempt](https://streamable.com/rh68a)

[Here he grabs multiple offensive rebounds in traffic vs the Portland guards and forwards and gets rewarded with FTs](https://streamable.com/51g5f). In college, one of his more notable weaknesses was his finishing at the rim. He got pushed off his spots easily and didn't do well with contact at the rim. A lot of this can be attributed to his lack of strength compared to his contemporaries, but it's worth noting. A more physically mature center probably gets the bucket at some point, but it's still good to see him give a lot of effort. 

Overall, Claxton had a pretty good first game. I don't think he was riddled with mistakes defensively. The cases he did get scored on in P&amp;R, it was by Dame who was destroying everyone. I think the Suns game, at least when Baynes isn't on the court, will another good match up for him. 

**Defensive adjustments by Atkinson**

For the ""AtKinSon DoSeN't MaKe AdJuStMeNtS"" or ""dRoP cOvErAgE dOeSn'T wOrK"" crowd, he did make defensive adjustments from the beginning of the game. He deviated from the normal drop coverage that the Nets run. Eventually, he went on to using 2-3 zones, box-and-one / face guarding, and blitzing P&amp;Rs with Lillard. None of it mattered much since Lillard was destroying them, but he cycled through a lot of options.

[For Lillard's first possession with the ball, he runs a P&amp;R with Whiteside, showing a clear different in defensive schemes] (https://streamable.com/u0urp). Normally, if the Nets are playing a non-shooting big (or a big man's shooting who they don't respect), [they drop back](https://i.imgur.com/kcgHIDE.png) to protect the paint and encourage difficult off-the-dribble pull up jumpers. Since Lillard is so good offensively, they can't do this because he can easily make those kind of shots. Instead, they bring Allen up to the same level as the screen and try to force Lillard into other options. 

[Here you see the same sort of deviation from the drop coverage, but involving Whiteside and CJ](https://streamable.com/d3gsk). Normally you'd see JA sag off Whiteside since he isn't a threat from outside of the paint, but since the guard play of the Blazers is so dynamic, they have him playing up on Whiteside.

[Temple face guards Lillard the entire possession, preventing him from getting the ball and forcing the teams to basically play 4v4.](https://streamable.com/7zknn) I want to say this is box-and-one, but the Nets aren't exactly in a box the entire time defensively. Box-and-one is a strategy that's commonly used at high school levels of basketball when the opposing team has a dominant scorer. [In the scheme, you have two defenders on opposite sides of the FT line and two defenders near the baseline opposite of each other.](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR1SSkfRYDPS4Il2JGUdJhbHVKxX5--RASgjbMQRsRW3p6jaWH1CA&amp;s) It's not common in the NBA, however, the Nets did use it last year vs. Kemba Walker. The more notable example would be when the Raptors used it against Steph and the Warriors in the finals. 

In the fourth quarter, we start to see the Nets Blitz any P&amp;R involving Lillard. [In this clip, we see that after a Lillard and Whiteside P&amp;R, JA and Caris blitz against Lillard in an attempt to force the ball out of his hands, which they do.](https://streamable.com/pbhl9) 

[Same quarter, Whiteside hands the ball off to Lillard, who gets blitz by JA and Kyrie. This time, Lillard makes a good pass to Whiteside, who slips to the rim](https://streamable.com/mf4so)

[Whiteside and Lillard are playing a two man game, but Lillard gets trapped by JA and Kyrie late the shot clock and is forced to pass to Whiteside, who misses](https://streamable.com/epo9f).

The Nets pretty much threw the kitchen sink at Lillard and he destroyed. Can't do much but tip your hat to Lillard, but it's worth mentioning the different adjustments made in-game by Atkinson.

**Miscellaneous**

So, there's an offensive play that the Blazers ran yesterday that's called ""Thumbs-Up"" that was used yesterday. [In the play, we see Simons swing the ball to Lillard after Little sets a pindown screen for him. Simons then gets a screen set for him by Whiteside that frees him up for the pass](https://streamable.com/8ad9z). You may think the play design is similar to something that the Nets have run in the last few years, and that would be true! Ironically enough, they got the play design most likely from when Allen Crabbe came out in the deal two seasons ago. [Here's the same play, but done differently by the Nets last season](https://twitter.com/HalfCourtHoops/status/1105256689232764929). Last season, the play was mostly run for Joe Harris. However, the play hasn't been ran at all this season for Harris. Maybe at some point they do run it for Harris or something, maybe they don't, but I thought it was worth noting that Portland used a play the Nets took from them. 

[Dinwiddie after his best performance of this season, first verse and hook only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gru4IfbKlfU)

Kurucs getting benched isn't encouraging at all, but he's been horrible, so it is justified. Nwaba was probably the better play tonight with how good the Blazers guards are. However, Nwaba suffers from the same problem Kurucs does: [He doesn't take damn threes.](https://streamable.com/zwzo4) If Kurucs is benched for an extended period like Nwaba was, the lack of reliable bench shooting is going to continue. In my opinion, Wilson Chandler is most likely the answer they need right now to help the, but since he's out, they'll have to make do. 

Atkinson played Musa again, granted it was for a grand total of six minutes. There isn't much to make of his performance, but post-game Atkinson did mention he played Musa to provide spacing for Dinwiddie (which goes back to the lack of reliable shooting on the bench issue). Maybe this is a sign that we're going to see Musa a little more [(something I mentioned they should consider)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/dpuec2/analysis_some_of_the_offensive_plays_the_nets_ran/). 

It'll be interesting to see what the Nets defensive coverage is when they play Phoenix tomorrow. Aaron Baynes is tippy-toeing his way into threes, so they it'll be hard to play drop coverage against them, unless they really want Baynes to beat them (not the worst idea if it gets the ball out of Booker's hands). I think if Rubio and Baynes run P&amp;R, they sag off since Rubio is a non-shooter, but if it's Booker and Baynes P&amp;R, we'll see the same coverage the Nets used yesterday.",120,8,2019-11-09,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/du1j7g/analysis_jarrett_allens_dominant_defensive/
GoNets,Not trading Bridges to Houston for our picks back was worse than anything that happened in the big 3 era ,"Was a ton of stuff during the big 3 era a disaster? Primarily both harden trades, absolutely. But I believe just about everything they did was justifiable at the time. 

Not trading Mikal to Houston for our picks back was a fireable offense.  Zach Lowe said on his podcast multiple times the Rockets offered all the picks back. Reading everyone’s reporting it seems the only pick that Houston was a little shakey giving back was this draft, but everyone says this draft stinks anyways and nets would have been free to rebuild.

You’d have all your picks going forward, plus your 6 extra firsts from other trades, and then you can trade Johnson, Claxton, DFS for even more firsts.

The front office and/or ownership is in complete denial about this team. I have been advocating for a rebuild since the offseason and was called a Mikal hater for saying last year was not sustainable. Mikal and his contract is worth infinitely more to a team that is trying to win than the Nets. 

You can’t try and be competitive with no all star talent and a dead max salary spot on your books. Once it became Simmons was done 
(which was basically his Nets debut if we’re being honest) the team had to face reality. 

The nets are punting on another season to pray that free agency comes back in 2025, stars just resign and ask out later now. And if we have to trade for say Donovan Mitchell, we will be a play in team with little to no assets. 

The Nets have been burned to historic proportions star chasing. Part of why our crowd is so awful is it’s been 15+ years since the Nets have had anything that resembles a homegrown team that stayed together. That’s what builds fanbases, and you build a homegrown team through the draft and by rebuilding. 

Would it suck to be bad for 2 years? Sure, but it would be sucking with a purpose and a plan, developing young talent who play hard every night. Now we suck for no reason.

First round picks all have cap holds at 120% the rookie scale slot until they are signed. Not exactly sure when and where this information was released but it seems for the 27th pick the cap hold is **$1,974,240**. It's not a ton but it could come into play in certain situations and trading for a 2020 pick is a very savvy move as by then it's likely that we'll be operating over the cap anyway.
___
**FAQ2. What current salary obligations do we have? What are some of the likely next steps Marks will take to maximize cap space?**

Below is the current salary cap table:

|Player|2019-20 Cap Hit|
:--|:--|
|Spencer Dinwiddie|$10,605,084|
|Joe Harris|$7,666,667|
|Taurean Prince|$3,481,986|
|Caris LeVert|$2,625,718|
|Jarrett Allen|$2,376,840|
|Dzanan Musa|$1,911,600|
|Shabazz Napier|$1,845,301|
|Rodions Kurucs|$1,699,236|
|Treveon Graham|$1,645,357|
|Deron Williams [Dead Cap]|$5,474,787|
|Incomplete Roster Charge ($897,158 x 3)|$2,691,474|
|**Total**|**$42,024,050**|
|**Projected Salary Cap**|$109,000,000|
|**Cap Space**|**$66,975,950**|

That cap space number assumes we denounce all our cap holds (I imagine we will except for DLo's depending on what we decide to do, more on that later). I expect Marks will also cut Treveon Graham and Shabazz Napier as they have non-guaranteed deals and that gets us to:

**FAQ3. Why are different values being cited for max contracts?**

There are 3 levels of ""Max"" Contracts that exist in the current NBA CBA. For the purposes of our discussion, all that is relevant for fitting a player into your cap is their starting year salary. (If you want to know how players are financially incentivized to stay with their current team, players can re-sign with their current team for a 5-year deal instead of a 4-year deal and the current team can also offer them up to 8% raises every year while the new team can only offer 5% raises.) For players with 0-6 years in the NBA it can start at 25% of the cap in the first year. For players with 7-9 years can start at 30% of the cap in the first year. And lastly, any player with 10 or more years of experience can start at 35% of the cap. This is going to come into play depending on who the Nets choose to pursue.

|Years of Experience|Qualifying Players|Starting Max Salary|
:--|:--|:--|
|10+|Kevin Durant, Al Hoford|$38,150,000|
|7-9|Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris|$32,700,000|
|0-6|D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle|$27,250,000|

Keep in mind you can effectively subtract $897,158 from these figures because signing a player would clear one of the incomplete roster holds.
___
**FAQ4. Can we currently sign Kyrie and KD? If not, how can we clear up space?**
As we are right now, even renouncing all cap holds and cutting Napier and Graham, we're a tiny bit short of the space required to sign both Kyrie and KD. We have $68,672,292 of space but need $69,055,684 ($38,150,000+$32,700,000-$897,158-$897,158). That means we're effectively $383,392 short which could be achieved by trading Musa away or maybe even have Kyrie and KD take a little bit less to fit them in without making a trade.
___
**FAQ5. Can we sign D'Angelo Russell, Kyrie Irving, and another max contract? If so, what moves are necessary?**

Since a lot of the media rumblings have Kyrie committed to the Nets and a lot of Nets fans want to keep DLo as well, I've seen this question a lot. And the answer is...it depends. If the two non-DLo players in question are **Kyrie + KD**, there needs to be around **$69,055,684** in cap space. If the two non-DLo players in question are **Kyrie + Kawhi/Butler/Tobias** there needs to be around **$63,605,684**. The best way to go about this would be to not renounce DLo's cap hold so he can count for **$21,059,094** against the cap while we go out and use up the open cap space. 

|Player|2019-20 Cap Hit|
:--|:--|
|Spencer Dinwiddie|$10,605,084|
|Joe Harris|$7,666,667|
|Taurean Prince|$3,481,986|
|Caris LeVert|$2,625,718|
|Jarrett Allen|$2,376,840|
|Dzanan Musa|$1,911,600|
|Rodions Kurucs|$1,699,236|
|**D'Angelo Russell [Cap Hold]**|$21,059,094|
|Deron Williams [Dead Cap]|$5,474,787|
|Incomplete Roster Charge ($897,158 x 4)|$3,588,632|
|**Total**|**$60,489,644**|
|**Projected Salary Cap**|$109,000,000|
|**Cap Space**|**$48,510,356**|

Adding that to the cap sheet and subtracting one of the incomplete roster charges leaves us **$48,510,356** in cap space. 

So keeping those numbers in mind, we can trade **Dinwiddie and Joe Harris** for no salary in return to get us to **$64,987,791**. That gives us enough space to pair together **Kyrie + Kawhi/Butler/Tobias** and then max **DLo** after but it would cost us Dinwiddie and Joe Harris which might not be an attractive move for Marks (unless it's Kawhi). It would probably require Marks to have a way undermarket contract agreement with JJ Redick or something to replace Joe for him to consider it.

-Side note: This is a suuuuuper pipe dream that I hesitated to even include because I'd give it a near 0% chance, but in case you want to know, if the Nets just moved Dinwiddie for 0 salary, Kyrie + Kawhi/Butler/Tobias would need to leave a combined **$5.4M** on the table. It's not exactly unprecedented with KD and Miami Heatles being some recent examples but I wouldn't get your hopes up.
___
**FAQ6. What is the difference in cap space in the DLo vs. Kyrie debate?**

The Nets fanbase has been going back and forth on this issue. It is true that choosing D'Angelo Russell over Kyrie could lead to a much stronger team overall, especially in terms of depth. Since we can agree to a deal with DLo and sign his contract last, he would effectively only count for **$20,059,094** while we conduct the rest of our free agency. After we sign as many players as can fit into the free space, we can go over the cap to sign him to the max. With DLo, we'd have **$48,510,356** to play with which means we could sign a KD or Kawhi/Butler/Tobias level free agent and still have roughly $11.25M or $16.7M respectively to work with. That is a sizable amount that could add a lot of depth to the roster.

The main problem is that signing Kyrie may be the only shot we have at attracting another star to come to Brooklyn as DLo doesn't carry the same cache with his NBA peers. In the case that we let DLo go and choose Kyrie, we would have **$36,869,450** in cap space. That means we'd still need to move another piece to get to the $37,252,842 a KD signing would necessitate and only leave $3,272,292 over if we paired Kyrie with Kawhi/Butler/Tobias. It's arguably still worth it, especially if we believe Marks has a true skill of finding good role players with limited resources but it would undoubtedly be a more top-heavy roster.",101,71,2019-06-21,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/c38x8p/postdraft_brooklyn_nets_salary_cap_and_free/

GoNets,[Rant] Tired of this fanbase,"I get that the journey over the last couple years has been rough, with going from a legit contender in the big three era to where we’re are now, but people need to get a fucking grip and get behind this squad. Do we need a superstar? Yes. Should we screw ourselves in the short term to get one before we have better trade value in developing players or a better understanding of what this squad is capable of? No. Could we use a better coach than JV? Yes. Do we have a better option? No. People need to realise that if we’re actually gonna win a chip we need to be patient and determine what our options are, whether trades or otherwise. If that means being slightly above .500 for a season or two that’s just the way it is. 

All of that aside I am sometimes ashamed to be a Nets fan, and not because of our record or for any of the reasons listed above - but because our fanbase fucking blows. People constantly bitching on this sub after every loss, empty seats at every game (I go to games frequently and have seen as much), barely any noise at said games. 

People gotta realise that regardless of their paycheque etc these guys want to play, and I like to think they give 100% on the court every game. It’s what we do best - being a scrappy no bullshit team win or lose. But regardless of trade prospects or what might happen going forward we need to get behind this group. I can’t overstate how important a teams culture and their fans are - and that’s one of our weaker points. 

I apologise to all of the fans to whom none of the above applies, I really do. But the constant bitching has to stop. That aside, I am happy at how this team sometimes surprises me with their level of play, and I believe good things are to come regardless of how deep a run we make this season. 

We have some great assets and young players, and their value will only get higher as they improve. We have some burgeoning superstars on both ends of the floor who just need a bit of a jump in some areas - things could be worse.

GoNets,It's getting kinda silly now...,"...the way people are reacting to last night's game. There was literally *nothing* on the line last night except for our player's health. Aside from that, though, some of you are acting like you didn't know this year would be a year where the team remained competitive while developing talent. I didn't hear anyone complaining when the game was close through 3 quarters and all these bench players were giving fans a sneak peek of what they might bring to the table down the road. I bet I won't hear anyone complaining when we're happy to see everyone who sat playing max minutes on this upcoming road trip either. Part of getting through an entire season is being mindful of balance and that was what happened last night. Vaughn didn't ""fuck up"" and he didn't treat the game like an exhibition (the funniest thing I've heard in the past 12 hours) and he's not immune to criticism, but some of what's being said about him in this instance is borderline mental. People really wanna see him fired over this? The Nets are not in contention for a title. They have the luxury of being able to give younger players some run and experiment a little bit. Just enjoy the games and be glad there's no drama with ego-maniac stars anymore. ",87,106,2023-12-28,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/18t2ks2/its_getting_kinda_silly_now/
GoNets,"The Athletic Trade Value on Cam Johnson, Dorian Finney-Smith, Day’ron Sharpe and Ben Simmons ","CAM JOHNSON:

Johnson is about as perfect a trade deadline candidate as you can find, because he fits like a glove everywhere and shouldn't be all that difficult to integrate midseason. He's in the middle of a career year, averaging 18.5 points, four rebounds and three assists. One of the league's elite shooters, Johnson is a 6-foot-8 wing who has made 39.6 percent of his 3s on nearly six attempts per game over a six-year career. He's deadly from the corners and can also make shots off all sorts of movement actions because he's one of the rare shooters who can make 3s from nearly any footwork. All you need to do to bring him into the mix midseason is plop him in the corner, allow him to relocate or run him off a few simple actions and he'll provide space for your best scorers and ballhandlers. Defensively, Johnson isn't a difference-maker, but he generally puts himself in the right spots, and he's big enough not to be hunted in mismatches regularly.

The only question here is regarding whether the Nets decide to actually move him. Because he's such a good shooter, he's a perfect developmental player to have around as the team enters a rebuilding era. His contract is also entirely reasonable. Johnson makes $22.5 million this season and has two years remaining for a total of $43 million. Given the way salaries will continue to rise over the next two years, he's probably a bit of a steal for a starting-quality player at that price point. The Nets can keep him and maintain all of their salary flexibility in future years. Because the market for him will be wide with his ability to fit anywhere (and because the team doesn't have to move him), expect the price point to be quite high if the Nets do trade him. Expect at least a first-rounder and a good prospect, if not just two first-rounders outright. Otherwise, they can just keep him.

Trade value

A first-round pick and interesting prospects

Best fits

Thunder, Mavericks, Lakers, Grizzlies, Cavaliers



DORIAN FINNEY-SMITH

Another one of those players who is a tailor-made fit as a deadline acquisition. He doesn't command a significant number of touches. He makes shots from 3, having already hit 42.2 percent from distance this season and 37.3 percent from 3 since 2019-20 on over 1,800 attempts. Finney-Smith is also a versatile defender. He's not quite as good as he was back when he was in his mid-to-late 20s with Dallas, but he's a plus there and still very long and competes at a high level on that end.Any team in need of an influx of shooting and defense — and many of them could use such a skill set contained in just one player's toolbox — would be interested.

Finney-Smith makes $14.9 million and has a player option for $15.4 million next year that will be an interesting decision. Does he try to maximize for another year or decline and get a deal for the longer term? Based on how he's playing so far, I think he should probably decline it, which means the Nets would do very well to move him before the deadline. He feels like one of the most likely players to be dealt.


Trade value

Late first-rounder or multiple good second-rounders

Best fits

Lakers, 76ers, Pacers



DAY’RON SHARPE 

Sharpe missed the first 21 games of the year with a strained hamstring, but he's back now and working his way into action. Last season, as a bench big, he was among the more productive in the league, averaging 6.8 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.4 assists in just 15 minutes per night. He's a monster rebounder but also has a bit more skill and footwork than initially meets the eye. At 23, he has the look of a long-term backup big in the NBA with some starting upside in a pinch down the road if things break right with his development on the defensive end. So given that, why would a rebuilding Nets team be looking to trade him? He's a restricted free agent this summer, and the team just signed Nic Claxton to a nine-figure deal last year. I don't know that I would want to necessarily stick around if I were Sharpe. I also don't know that I'd necessarily want to pay Sharpe if I were Brooklyn, even if the price shouldn't be outrageous. A couple of second-round picks seem like a reasonable price point for everyone. He could end up proving himself a useful backup big man this year.

Trade value

Second-rounders

Best fits

Lakers, Pelicans, Thunder, Nuggets, Wizards



BEN SIMMONS 


Simmons is here purely because he's finally on an expiring contract now that his rookie-scale max contract has run its course. Simmons makes $40.3 million this season and obviously would only be moved if the Nets decided that they wanted to spring a deal for a star player. Simmons has played 19 games this year and is getting 24 minutes per night. He's averaging 5.1 points but also getting 5.6 rebounds and dishing out 6.5 assists. The Nets play him as a sort of makeshift point center who grabs and goes on the break and takes advantage of odd-man opportunities. This has been my sort of dream role for Simmons going back to his later days in Philadelphia, idealizing the theory of becoming a modern Draymond Green-style forward. Simmons is switchable, but I don't think he necessarily seems to love dealing with bigs on the block in the way Green does. He also doesn't seem to have enough confidence as a scorer. But if the Nets don't move him at the deadline because his price tag is too high, I'd be somewhat intrigued by him as a buyout candidate for a defense-needy team if he'd be willing to come in and play a role off the bench. He's had real flashes on defense this year, flying around in space and sliding to cut off drives against wings.

GoNets,3x scoring champ James Harden could be a Brooklyn Net in three days!,"TL;DR Farbod Esnaashari said a Harden-Nets trade would be announced November 22, and there is reason to believe the trade details are actively being figured out this week.

Last weekend, Farbod Esnaashari broke the news that James Harden to the Nets was a “real possibility” and “practically a done deal”. 

In addition to Farbod, Anthony Puccio made his own report this week saying that there is a verbal agreement between the Nets and Rockets.

These reports are still out there, but it has been a discouraging few days if you want the trade to happen. Houston is saying they’re willing to get “uncomfortable” with Harden (and Westbrook). Woj said it’s most likely that Harden starts training camp in Houston. Also, the Rockets are still the favorite to roster Harden at the start of the season as of two days ago on Odds Shark.

Harden is not a Brooklyn Net right now, and may never end up becoming one, but I think there’s still juice to Farbod and Pooch‘s reports that a deal will happen. Neither of their reports have been disproven.

Farbod’s original report said that the “little details” still needed to be ironed out, but if finalized, the trade would be announced on NOVEMBER 22ND. That’s three days from now.

Houston may have changed their stance on Harden since Farbod and Pooch got intel from their respective sources, but I think what’s most likely happening is the details are still being discussed and Harden ends up in Brooklyn.

I’m not an NBA insider so I don’t know what the Rockets are asking the Nets for and what the Nets have offered, but if the trade is still alive, I would bet that the Rockets are figuring out how to best set themselves up in a post Harden era. It seems that all the key contributors in Houston (Harden, Westbrook, Tucker, Gordon) are unhappy and/or want out. Covington is already gone and Austin Rivers opted out. Do the Rockets try to remain relevant and competitive this season, or do they tank?

James Harden could publicly request a trade one night, but that doesn’t mean the Rockets can trade him away that same night. They’re likely figuring out a gameplan. Do the Rockets want 3 or 4 immediate starters from the Nets plus picks, or would they prefer less players, but a motherload of picks? 

Other teams can enter the fold and move their picks to Houston to take on any of LeVert, Dinwiddie, Allen, Prince, etc. if Houston doesn’t want them.

The Rockets understandably want a significant return if they trade away James Harden, even if no return can equate to losing a superstar. I’m sure they want a sizable return for Westbrook as well, given they traded away future assets for him.

The Nets spent this week cutting salary and luxury tax, and added two guards to an already crowded guard rotation. Joe Harris also still needs to be re-signed. Something has to give there.

The Rockets also made moves this week trading away players to acquire first round picks and to cut salary of their own. Both teams’ moves may make sense even if a Harden trade doesn’t happen, but they feel like a precursor to bigger moves.

The Nets may not get James Harden on Sunday, and they may not end up getting him at all, but I don’t think a trade not happening yet nor the NBA Draft passing means that Harden won’t be a Net.

The Nets will contend regardless of roster construction this season, and I understand the fanbase that doesn’t want the Nets to break up their core. I just think acquiring Harden raises both the Nets’ floor and their ceiling. James Harden and Kevin Durant would be one of the best duos in the history of basketball.

What do you think it would take for the Nets to have a more established and excited fanbase?",74,71,2022-12-31,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1003hui/when_will_the_nets_have_a_more_established/
GoNets,Video Breakdown: James Harden's Bench Unit,"What's up guys. Some of you might remember I did a fair bit of video work on this sub last season. I'm starting to do that once more across NBA subreddits, but I've been publishing BK-specific  content frequently over at Nets Republic, a great blog-site for Nets coverage (Twitter: LucasKaplan\_NBA). Anyway, sorry for the promo, let's get into it.

Of all the wonderful tidbits the Nets-Clippers game produced last night, one that stood out to me was the production of the Nets bench unit, led by James Harden. Typically, Coach Nash has been running out a Harden/Harris/Green to anchor lineups with two of Brown/TLC/Perry. Last night, though, he kept Harden/Harris in with Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, and DeAndre Jordan, with positive results:

[**Shamet x Harden**](https://streamable.com/ktwqpf)

The Nets have loved using Joe Harris as a screener for James Harden. Last night, they used Shamet in that role. Above, you can see how defenses have problems with a dynamic shooter screening for James Harden. First, Shamet slips the screen amid some Clipper confusion for a wide open lay-up. Lou Williams, in his pursuit to deny Harden the ball, doesn't realize Batum is desperately trying to switch him off the Beard. Next time down the floor, the Nets run the same action. Batum does his best to chase Harden around two screens, but he gets a good look at a 3 anyway.

[**On-ball**](https://streamable.com/pbghq4)

Here, Shamet sets a ball-screen early in the shot clock for Harden, on an open side of the floor. The Clippers are screwed immediately. They can't possibly switch Lou Williams onto Harden, and by the time PG gets there, Shamet's already darted to the arc for an open 3. Playing Harris and Shamet with Harden creates a dynamic where the Nets can use a shooter to screen, and use the other to space the floor.

[**Ball movement**](https://streamable.com/hsca7g) 

This line-up also puts three great shooters with varying ball-handling ability on the perimeter together. This is easy offense. Again, Shamet screens for Harden. Off that action, he and Harris beat the defenders and scramble the defense, allowing Harden to attack a long close-out from PG. Harris and Shamet don't have to be world-beaters off the dribble; they certainly can handle enough to create these sorts of advantages. 

[**On defense,**](https://streamable.com/dfwvgv)

the Nets were switching 1-4, with Jordan in drop coverage, leaving them susceptible to mid-range jump shooters like Lou Will. But, having

[**Bruce Brown**](https://streamable.com/j6phd4)

on the floor, guarding the other team's best player, can shore up that weak spot. He's a bulldog getting over screens and pressure ball-handlers. Offensively, though, Brown can 

[**Clog the lane**](https://streamable.com/1o7yde)

when Harden and DJ are running pick n' rolls. Above, his defender, Marcus Morris, cheats off him, all the way under the basket, and disrupts and lob to Jordan. No matter how deadly the other three players are, having two non-threats from the perimeter will hamstring an offense from time-to-time. An unorthodox move to combat this that we've seen in recent games, though, is the Nets using  

[**Brown as a roller**](https://streamable.com/big7ne)**.**

Taking DJ off the court allows the Nets to switch every ball-screen on defense, and still use a rim-diver to screen for Harden. Brown has been great finishing in the paint this year, and here, he makes a nice pass after Harden gets doubled, leading to an open 3. KD is on the floor here, but it's easy to imagine Shamet in his place. I'd be interesting in seeing if the Nets do run a Harden-Shamet-Brown-Harris-Green five vs. bench units on nights when Green doesn't start.",73,6,2021-02-04,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/lc5q9d/video_breakdown_james_hardens_bench_unit/

GoNets,All of the important things said during the 2025 Brooklyn Nets Draft Class Introductory Press Conference,"Comments from Sean Marks:

- Sean Marks specifically mentioned that while Best Player Available was a factor in each draft pick, they were looking for versatility and flexibility so there's no limits to how these guys play.
- Sean Marks says the Brooklyn and Long Island Nets will continue to have communication with each other so when guys are sent to Long Island, they don't miss anything and so they can continue to see guys take leaps and play meaningful minutes when they return back to Brooklyn. They want to foster a competitive environment to bring the best out of these guys.
- Sean Marks says the connection between him, Jordi and the coaching staff is important not only for drafting but for Free Agency and Trades. They want to always figure out how each and every player may fit within the team before making decisions. 
- Sean Marks says the expectation is to compete and there will be no limit on what the team does. They will not lose a certain amount of games or make any decisions like that. They will compete.
- Sean gives a lot of credit to the scouting team for helping him lay eyes on all the guys they've drafted. The scouting team played a big part of identifying these guys and figuring out how they'd fit with the team. We should expect to see a big rise in their development quick but there will be a learning curve. He emphasized that we need to all remember they're 19. 

Comments from Coach Jordi:

- Jordi: ""We want to play w/ pace. In my opinion we have the fastest guy in the draft. We have a lot of playmaking. All these guys can really pass...it helps when you have not just primarily ballhandlers but also secondary ballhandlers &amp; all these guys can do it.""

- Jordi: ""I'm starting with defense. Positional size is very important, right? And you guys can see here, with your eye test, I would play these guys almost, you know, one-through-four, one through-five. So that's a good thing for us. You'll see length, athleticism, and we'll keep working on that physicality, communication.""

- Jordi on why the Nets were so excited to draft Egor Demin: “His positional size and his playmaking. Obviously, it’s very important that we help each other and we give each other the best shot possible, and we believe that he can do it. Whether playing pick and roll or simply making the right play. That’s who he is, and if you watch him play and you get to know him, you can see that right away. His ability to shoot the ball. He’s gonna shoot the ball very well in this league. That is another thing that excites us. But also his work ethic. We know he’s gonna show up, he’s gonna work every day. That’s something that caught our eye. Because as you know, it’s not just watching them play real games, but we know a lot about these guys. That’s what you do through the process. Like Sean said, the coaches who were a part of the process were amazing. The group did an amazing job and us [coaches] being involved in it was very unique for me from my experience. And selecting Egor, another thing that I believe he’s gonna help us with is his fullcourt pace. His ability to throw the ball ahead, that’s also gonna help the team. We were pretty fast in the halfcourt and slow in the fullcourt, and I think he’s gonna help us be faster in the fullcourt.”

- Jordi said it will ""be on him"" to figure out how to get the five Nets rookies minutes and aid their development. Added that he'll likely have a 10-man rotation next season.

Comments from Egor, Nolan, Drake, Ben and Danny:

- The young guys all say they're excited to get to know each other but for Summer League and the preseason as well. They're ready to start on the right foot and build chemistry with one another. 
- Egor says his name is Yay-gor Deh-men (pronunciation wise). Egor believes the Nets is a really good fit for them and they can be a really fast paced team. He wants to rebound, find someone in front of him and outlet as quick as possible. And he wants to do whatever coach needs him to do.
- Egor Demin says he did in fact speak to Andrei Kirilenko as it was important to his parents. AK called him the next day after being drafted to the Nets and AK gave him advice. He also told Egor he was really happy he landed with the Nets.
- Egor is ready to be whatever position the Nets need to him to be. His role is to learn whatever the Nets need him to be off and on the ball as that's part of his development. He doesn't view himself as any particular role.
- Egor Demin got a lot of chuckles, saying ""I believe we can really find good offensive and defensive variety ... There's going to be rotations where we just switch everything,"" Then looks around to Jordi and Sean and says, ""Well, it's not my decision anymore.""
- Nolan says he's already started to work with the Nets and he is excited for the journey. He also likes the city, lol. Sean enjoyed watching Nolan play live and in person because you saw his speed, breaking down defenses and he found him really exciting. He also loved getting to know Nolan because he's a quiet leader and he saw the respect Nolan got from his older teammate. 
- Drake Powell says he's gonna make an immediate impact and do whatever he can to the best of his ability to help with the team's defense.
- Sean says Ben Saraf's pride on defense, finishing around the basketball and not shying away from contact is what inspired them to draft him. As for Danny Wolf, it was his IQ and size that inspired the team to draft them. Ben Saraf says the Jewish community has already shown him a lot of love and excitement, which he really appreciated. 
- Sean is excited to have Ben and Danny as they're great ambassadors for the Jewish Community.
- Drake says his everyday preparation allowed him to put trust in his vets as he just tried to shadow them. That preparation is what'll let him be ready for his time with the Nets.

Then, it suddenly ended lol",72,74,2025-07-01,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1lp88sm/all_of_the_important_things_said_during_the_2025/
GoNets,That was some really classy stuff LBJ did today. Gotta reflect on that.,"I said earlier today there's only two names I've ever worn on my back.  That's 42 Brooklyn and 21 Pittsburgh, Robinson and Clemente, because they were more than just athletes, but wanted to change the world.  Today LeBron joined that group.  Watching what LeBron did today, can't lie, I got a little choked up.  We all have those issues that we have a soft spot for.  For me it's immigrant rights, single moms and education for disadvantaged youth.  Hate to steal LeBron's ""I'm not supposed to be here"" but I have several family members who saw more of a future in the streets than in schools, and you know the stories of how that goes.  I sometimes think, damn, I'm not doing Nike commercials but I'm doing okay.  Not in jail, not dead.  Thank God.  How did that fate skip me?  My parents were very strict about education, and maybe that's why I felt especially touched today.  

Obviously we all don't have the resources to open schools, but we can contribute in however small way we can.  It's not a handout but an investment in society.  

Let's not forget our own Spencer Dinwiddie.  He may not have the name recognition of LeBron but he's doing the most he can with his platform and the Dinwiddie Family Foundation.  I actually got to speak with him about it a little while back, and he sounds as passionate about his project as LeBron does about his.  I told him and myself, and now I'm telling you folks, I'd get involved in it but haven't done so yet.  So that's in my August plans.  I""ve now told the world, so now I gotta come through. 

That's it.  Just wanted to say we all have not only the opportunity but the obligation to make the world a little better, no matter how small the gesture.  Peace!  ",71,5,2018-08-01,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/93l8xx/that_was_some_really_classy_stuff_lbj_did_today/

GoNets,"[Brooklyn Nets] This could be their starting lineup. Irving, Harris, LeVert, Durant, Allen.","https://preview.redd.it/4xwyk99fz5731.jpg?width=3205&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f33132b651a8747f05d6367be17a0d5acf8b3aa

This of course would be a dream scenario, but would this team be enough to conquer the East?  
We really exceeded expectations with a team full of young and developing players, and if we make   
these acquisitions plus other minor tweaks. It would be awesome and another step in the right direction.  


There are many moving pieces to this puzzle and these situations will have to go according to plan

* \[**Irving** has to focus on actual basketball and not be distracted by the media\]
* \[**Harris** needs to forget about this past playoff performance and continue his regular season form\]
* \[**LeVert** has to stay healthy and continue being aggressive on the offensive end\]
* \[**Durant** will have to modify his approach due to his achilles injury\]
* \[**Allen** continues to improve on the defensive end, while adding muscle to his frame and maybe   
adds a mid-range jumper\]

&amp;#x200B;

**Their bench is a strength and one of the deepest in the NBA. They were top 5 in** ***MPG*****,** ***PPG*****,** ***Net Rating***

* **Dinwiddie** will lead the second team and at times will lead the first team if Irving misses a game   
\[*which will be the case, the Nets are careful with injuries and will rather lose games than a player for the year*\]. 
* The addition of **Tearuan Prince** is an underrated one, in my opinion they knew that Carroll was not resigning with them so they traded for a player who was selected in the lottery and also has similar   
traits but is 7 years younger. A stretch 3 with the ability to cover multiple positions and bang inside.  
They gave up their 1st rounder this year for him, only to get a 2020 back by trading back in the draft.
* **Rodion Kurucs** displayed glimpses on both ends of the floor last year and needs to become more comfortable being in uncomfortable positions. His 3 point shooting in the playoffs (25%) slipped from   
the regular season (31.5%) and at times was out of position versus Philadelphia. This is natural for a rookie, he'll need to put in the work this summer. He the tools and attitude to be part of this team for a long time.
* A prediction is that I believe they will keep **Jared Dudley**, the spokesman of the team.
* **Napier** will be signed for another year unless another they decide to move him. He could be valuable   
on a team that lacks point guard depth and experience \[for example the Suns\]. A capable scorer and   
proved that when Dinwiddie was out with his hurt thumb.
* Players battling for minutes but will eventually see the floor because of rest or injuries will be   
**Treveon Graham**, **Theo Pinson**, **Alan Williams**, **Jaylen Hands**. Let's hope Pinson goes   
swimming this year, and keeps the bench energy going. It's vital to the team culture.
* I do think there will be some early surprises next year like **Dzanan Musa** and **Nic Claxton** earning   
minutes. As we've learned with Rodi, Atkinson is not afraid to plug in young players into the game   
if they put in the work and if they are ready to contribute by any means necessary. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Departures and good-byes**

* They will miss Mr. Swag’s \[**Demarre Carroll**\] leadership and offensive savviness that bailed them out of many lost possessions by getting to the free throw line. 
* **Ed Davis** will most likely leave as well, and is easily one of the most efficient players in the league.   
If they resign him, it will be a huge accomplishment by the organization.
* **D'Angelo Russell** will most likely be on another team which honestly makes me a little sad.   
I have watched every Nets game for the past couple of seasons and I've seen his development   
since he first arrived from Los Angeles. His decision making has accelerated but the time on the   
court has slowed down in his mind, he is now seeing a couple plays ahead. From outcast to all-star,   
DLO deserves the money he is inevitably going to receive from whichever team offers it. I'll always remember watching the Kings game this year where he went full DLOADING and basically showed the whole NBA they were wrong about him.
* **Rondae-Hollis-Jefferson** Going back to the Kings game where RHJ got the unorthodox game winner, this play symbolizes who he is as a player. Tough, gritty and willing to do whatever it takes for the team.  
He's an OG Net, and has stuck it out with them. I was so happy when they made the playoffs in his last year here. He still has ways to go on the offensive end but I believe he’ll eventually knock down that 3 pointer consistently. A team that needs a versatile defender and glue guy will take a shot with RHJ. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I haven’t been this excited for the Nets free agency since we got Vince Carter** 

* \[The trade for Pierce + Garnett wasn’t that exciting knowing their age would limit our window\] 
* \[Deron Williams was a little exciting but I worried about his ankles holding up\] 
* \[Joe Johnson was awesome but it was later in his career, would of been more excited   
if it was in his early Atlanta days\] 

&amp;#x200B;

**Expectations**

There will be many questions about this team, as there are for every other team in the NBA but these Nets came from the mud and are now here to compete in the East once again. If they do acquire Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant it'll be the first time since the Jason Kidd, Richard Jefferson, Kenyon Martin days where we had stars in their prime ready to take that leap once again. What does everyone think? Will they be contenders,   
will it not even happen, or will it happen and not go as planned?

GoNets,TIL: Kyrie Irving is the NBA’s second-leading sneaker salesman behind only LeBron James,"From a feature on how Kyrie Irving is ""in the absolute epicenter"" of basketball sneaker culture [in The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/1433512/2019/12/05/from-wheaties-to-spongebob-how-kyrie-irvings-shoe-designs-took-over-the-basketball-world/?source=dailyemail):

&gt;In the middle of an on-court scuffle between the Nets and Knicks on Oct. 25, Kyrie Irving and Bobby Portis were going at it when YES Network commentator and former NBA player Richard Jefferson made an observation.  
&gt;  
&gt;“(Irving)’s fighting someone that’s wearing his shoes,” Jefferson said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Portis, sporting a pair of Kyrie Low 2s from Nike, tried to rip the ball out of Irving’s hands on a play Irving presumed was blown dead. It wasn’t the first time an Irving opponent was wearing his signature sneakers, a version of which retails for about $110. Pay attention to players’ feet next time you watch any NBA game — odds are you’ll see multiple players wearing a pair of Kyries, including stars like Luka Doncic, Ja Morant and Jrue Holiday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Considered an innovator among athletes for his outside-the-box design inspirations, Irving is quickly becoming a cult hero in the sneaker world for players and sneakerheads alike. He made $11 million from the company during the last fiscal year, according to Forbes. At the end of the 2017-18 season, Irving was the NBA’s second-leading sneaker salesman behind only LeBron James, according to the NPD Group, which tracks retail industry trends.  
&gt;  
&gt;“He’s in the absolute epicenter of basketball culture,” said Matt Powell, a sports retail analyst for NPD Group. “And LeBron, who would have been the leader, is now (playing) in a market that doesn’t care about basketball shoes.”

I follow the NBA really closely, but can't tell you the first thing about sneakerhead culture, so this was a pretty educational read.",68,17,2019-12-05,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/e6jpur/til_kyrie_irving_is_the_nbas_secondleading/

Spence Dinwiddie is legit. Jarrett Allen can freaking ball (can’t believe the kid is 19), the skill and effort were there but he was just a bit passive, then again he’s a teen two years away from legally drinking... He’ll definitely get better with more experience and will be a monster in 5 years. Caris levert is pretty good (didn’t have the best game tonight). And good lord that man Rondae Hollis Jefferson aka Tupac can ball.

GoNets,Watching the Redeem Team on Netflix and the Giants this season was a reminder on the importance of a good coach,"Larry Brown had a team of Duncan, AI, Lebron, Wade and Carmelo and still couldn't beat Puerto Rico. Some of those guys were young but still. To win, they needed proper roster construction and the right coach. 

The Nets had too many small guards last season and arguably the wrong coach. I've stated multiple times before that Nash like Kidd will probably end up as a good coach one day, but needs time and experience. When Harden, KD and Kyrie all have no confidence in Nash, to the point of wanting out, that's saying something.

GoNets,ben simmons return,"An alarm rings. A large figure slowly emerges from beneath satin sheets, thread count of 2600. A deep voice- youthful, strong, yet soulless, reverbs off his walls.

""Siri, what day is it mate?""

""The date is April 25""

A wave of anxiety washes over the man. He proceeds to his bathroom with long calculated strides. His hands tremble in anticipation of what's to come as he pulls out his Johnson from his silk boxers. Doubt creeps in as he takes aim. Then the shame. He's done this a million times before. Why is today so different? So hard?

Aware of every breath he takes, cognizant of every passing and fanciful thought, he gets the sense he is alive.

He releases a strong healthy stream of urine, accumulated from hours of slumber. Not fully awake and unsteady, he paints the rim and the surrounding laminate marble tiles with a fresh coat of liquid gold.

""Hmm... progress.""

Getting through the rest of his morning routine without much incident calms his nerves, if only just a little.

The rest of the day is a blur. The next thing he remembers is his arrival at the Garden. Still unfamiliar and uncomfortable in these new circumstances, his walk slows to a sedated pace.

In the locker room his teammates are getting taped up and ready for today's game. There is an energy in the air. Electric- fully charged by a conglomerate of his motivated, testesterone filled acquaintances.

A raspy voice brings him back to reality.

""Why so late Ben?""

Ben's gaze meets Nash's lazy eye. Still unsure which one to look at, he looks down, fixated on the floor he replies curtly,

""Therapy.""

""Right.""

At his locker rests his jersey in black and white. Devoid of emotion, he strips skyclad, his well toned body, flawless skin and imposing physique highlighted by fluorescent lights, he puts on his new identity. A Brooklyn Net.

The raspy voice pierces the atmosphere again. It's time for warmups.

Walking out of the tunnel, Ben braces himself emotionally. His thoughts wander to Kyrie and the wisdom Uncle Drew generously offered him earlier in the month. Don't fucking listen to the haters. They're pawns, simpletons, meaningless organisms  wandering without purpose in this illusionary world. It isn't real. This isn't real. Nothing is real.

Ben's lips give birth to a sly smirk. Nothing the crowd says today will hurt him. Sticks and stones. A wave of confidence and resolve overtakes him.

I will show them.

His meek stroll transforms into energetic strides. As he materializes from the tunnel, the boos rain in the nanosecond the photons from the arena lights bounces from his frame into the spectators' eyes. He hears nothing.

Having now integrated himself into the Net's shooting warmups, a ball boy directs a bounce pass straight to Ben. Caressing Wilson's leather, malicious voices begin to penetrate the mental barrier he had erected not even a minute ago.

""He won't even shoot in warmups, the fucking pussy!""

""Let me diagnose you with my cock, Ben!""

""$10,000 dollars you airball RIGHT NOW BEN!""

I'll prove them wrong.

Ben takes a rhythm dribble and squares up. He rises for the shot with certainty. His feet set, torso and limbs employed in perfect harmony. The ball leaves his fingertips. Watching the ball glide through the air, he knows this one is pure. The trajectory and velocity are flawless. Wrist as a goose's neck that would make a 90's Bulls fan jealous, he eagerly waits for the ball to swish through the net.

""Get that weak shit outta here!""

Blake Griffin punches the shot away from under as the ball descends just past the front rim. He points and laughs at Ben.

""Just a prank bro! LOL!""

Ben feels hell's heat permeate his cheeks. Who the fuck actually verbally says ""lol""? And that shot was money. It would take him months, if not years to get a shot as true as the one he had just so meaningfully assembled.

Mind reeling from this great injustice, he slips into the dark depths of his mind once again. Maybe it was never meant to be. Maybe I will never make a three pointer like everybody says. Maybe, I'm not good enough. His world fades to black.

TWEET ""8 seconds. Celtic’s ball""

Brought back to his senses, Ben takes in his surroundings and realizes the game has started. He looks up to the scoreboard. It reads 0-0, Q1 11:52.

""What the fuck Ben? Wake the fuck up cunt!"" shrieks Patty Mills as he claps in Simmons' face.

He situates himself at the top of the key, eyeing Jayson Tatum as he struts himself and the ball past halfcourt. As he dribbles for the 18th time between his legs, instincts take over and he reaches out for the ball. His hands touch leather, and the ball is once again liberated from Tatum’s tyranny, rolling blissfully towards half court. Simmons bursts towards it, scooping it up easily with his great length and capable hands.

He accelerates to the other end, a lifetime of experience and a wealth of talent about to manifest into an unforgettable moment. As he nears the goal, a tall, dark, familiar fearsome figure stands ready. Timelord is already in position to protect the rim, ready to stop him by any means necessary.

Having second thoughts, Simmons pulls back and waits for his squad to set up in the half court. The crowd starts to jeer and boo and the crowd starts to chant...

""Fuck Ben Simmons!""

Clap clap, clapclapclap

""Fuck Ben Simmons!""

Clap clap, clapclapclap

He swings the ball to Durant. Struggling with himself in this moment, he attempts to drown the nagging, persistent thoughts of inadequacy by rationalizing, I'm the facilitator. I can't be selfish. I'm NOT a pussy.

The Slim Reaper is swiftly doubled, and the ball finds itself back in Simmons' hands. He surveys the floor. Timelord is on the weakside, a full step away from the paint. The only obstacle between him and the basket is a pudgy beard.

Ben begins his dribble. The noise fades away. His focus steeled and centered to the rim. He brings the ball to his right, then hesitates, then explodes back to his left. Marcus Smart, in a feeble attempt to maintain his facade of giving an effort on defense, raises his arm while his feet remain fastened to the hardwood and hits Ben across the shoulder.

No whistle

Timelord reacts swiftly, moving with purpose to defend the rim at all costs. Simmons sees him coming, but it does not matter. Not one bit.

Ben gathers the ball, takes three legal powerful steps and takes flight...

GoNets,Let's bring some positivity. Say something nice about this season.,"Yes, it's been absolutely dreadful.  But not here to talk about coaching, defense or Ben Simmons.  Just some bright spots in this dark season.  I'll start:

1.  I never get tired of that Nets commercial filmed around Brooklyn with the ""You Can't Turn Me Away"" beat.  
2. I initially hated the KAWS uniforms but they've grown on me to the point where I really like them now.  
3. Yeah, the on-court product has been disgusting but the Barclays fan experience has definitely improved.  I skipped a lot of games this year but the ones I went to I saw MOP and Rakim performing at halftime.  For an old school NYC hip hop head like myself, Rakim is legendary.  I got to meet DJ Mister Cee on the concourse one night after performing pregame.  I was there for West Indian Night, that was pretty cool too.  The Chinese New Year games are becoming a can't-miss event each year because of the exclusive merch.  

Any other bright spots this season?  ",61,94,2024-03-28,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1bq0lwp/lets_bring_some_positivity_say_something_nice/
GoNets,Thank You Nets fans! (Quick trip update).,"Last week I made a post asking for advice on a few things and you guys were all so considerate and welcoming.  Tons of great info and with the help of the search function I was able to do some research and get some relatively good seats for the price (upper corners).

Let me tell you, what an experience.  I’m from Canada and the closest NBA team is 1500 miles away.  I’ve been to a few games in my time (LA, PHX, TOR)  but Barclays was rocking!!
I Love the Brooklyn Vibe with 90s hip hop and I am so glad you guys embrace Jay Z and Biggie.  I saw the banners next to the Canadian flag lol.

I am so amazed by your city and I wish I had more time.  I’ll be back, I didn’t even get to do anything besides the game.  You all had some great suggestions for Pizza and Fried Chicken and I was unable to do either (Sad).
Except for Chicken Fingers at Barclays but that doesn’t count..  I was so overwhelmed I just hopped in a line and got something. Lol

I under estimated how busy and crazy Brooklyn is but I loved every second of it.
Even though you hear how insane it is, you don’t know until you get thrown into it.  We were staying in New Jersey (For work) and I guess I should have asked how the drive is from NJ to Brooklyn lol
We should have just Ubered it.  After the white knuckle drive (Our busiest roads are 2 lanes and you can get anywhere in the city within 25 minutes Lol) and the attempt to find parking.  We were regretting it.  BUT, I think everyone needs to experience it just once.  We did find parking, and it was 75% of the cost of taking an uber….  Maybe the most impressive thing I saw that night was how this parking garage was able to Tetris in 60+ cars into a space that looked like it could fit 20.
 
Anyways I’m rambling.  I’ll be back.  Thank you all, I love your city and most of it I saw from a distance.  You are all very lucky to be a part of such a special place.

- Your new Canadian friend (Nets are now my second favourite team) 🙂",60,2,2024-01-30,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1aeszc0/thank_you_nets_fans_quick_trip_update/

GoNets,Egor really is letting it fly in Summer League,"Egor Demin in the four tournament Summer League games took 11 3's per 36 minutes with 85% of his shots being 3 points and the overwhelming majority of those of the catch-and-shoot variety. He shot well from 3 too (43%), which gives us an indication of the kind of role he's likely to play for the Nets, at least initially, and their vision of him. He's a connective wing who can make shots, make solid passing reads, and defend well against 2's and 3's. He'll get better defensively with strength and experience but he has shown good reactivity and mobility throughout the week, has put the effort in, and has the upside to be a plus on the defensive end as well.

Gaining strength is a necessity but we can't say aggression wasn't there when he's letting it fly this way. He's taking the shots available and making them. Passivity was a concern of his coming out but he's letting it fly from 3 which has been a great thing to watch. That shows confidence. Yes, the ability to score out of closeouts and effectively put the ball on the floor is going to be critical for him as we head into training camp and the start of the season, but this week has been a great first step in Egor's professional journey. Nets fans are right to be very excited about Egor Demin.",55,21,2025-07-18,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1m334v7/egor_really_is_letting_it_fly_in_summer_league/
GoNets,Optimistic but frustrated AF,"1. KD was horrific by his standards but superstars like him usually have big response games. 

2. We were so damn sloppy 1st half. Way too many times the guy running the play was pounding the shit out of the rock before any play set up leading to easy predictable plays for Cs to get TOs 

3. Surely we cannot play a worse last 40 seconds of basketball the whole series. Right? The quick 2 for the Cs is absolutely inexcusable. Even forcing a bleed the clock 2 point shot works far better in nets favour. 

4. Kyrie is in his bag. Personally loved the shit he was pulling to the crowd. He cares so much and is desperate not to lose. Every player should have Kais mentality

That game was a near terrible showing and we lost on a buzzer beater. The nets are a better team overall but the lazy errors will make this series a nail biter.",54,43,2022-04-18,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/u62r6e/optimistic_but_frustrated_af/
GoNets,Allen Crabbe's defense,"Over the past few days I had been having mixed feelings towards the Allan Crabbe trade.  I liked that Marks is being aggressive and continues to add talent to the Nets.  However, after reading multiple articles about Crabbe, most notably his Season Review Blazer's Edge  https://www.blazersedge.com/2017/5/19/15666308/allen-crabbe-season-review-portland-trail-blazers-2016-2017 , I began to seriously question if this was a bad trade.

From BlazerEdge:  *""Defensive advanced stats suggested that Crabbe is glaringly bad. Among Blazers players, he had the worst defensive rating on the team, third worst defensive box plus/minus (behind CJ McCollum and Damian Lillard), and worst defensive real plus/minus.""*

Is this true?  I thought last off season when the Nets made a run at him he was a good defender.   Instead of a 3 and D, is Crabbe a 3 and terrible D?  

I haven't watched enough Blazers games to make a real judgement.  I assume most Nets fan haven't.  Sadly there aren't many lengthy clips of Crabbe's defense from last season online to make a personal opinion on the matter either.  So I looked into it.  

The first thing I note is that the reference of his defensive rating  (basketball-reference.com) is not consistent with other web-sites.  Basketball-Reference.com had him at a defensive rating of 114.  But then checking on NBA.com  I see a defensive rating of 108.9, which is very middle of the pack (For perspective, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is a 107.7 defensive rating on NBA.com).  FoxSports had yet another number.  So how can we take this metric seriously when it is being calculated differently from every source. 

Secondly, what is defensive rating?  I googled it and came up with this:

The formula is: *Defensive Rating = (Opponent's Points Allowed/ Opponent's Possessions) x 100. The result is the expected amount of points that an individual player will allow on defense over 100 possessions. This stat can be significantly influenced by the defense of a player's teammates.*

This seemed incredibly biased based on a team's defense and style.  I would think that a team's defense has more to do with a player's defensive rating then the actual player. In fact, if you look at  the Blazer's defensive rating per player you can see a lot of players correlate http://stats.nba.com/players/defense/#!?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612757

Damian Lillard (108.9), McCollum (107.9), and Harkless (108.3) who along with Crabbe (108.9) were the four players that the most minutes for the Blazers last season.  And they all had similar defensive ratings.  Again, this leads me to believe defensive rating has a lot more to do with team play than individual defense.

Further, I looked at Joe Johnson on basketball-reference.com and he had a defensive rating of 112.0 on the Nets in 2016 while a 108.1 in Utah this past season.  It is unlikely that Johnson after 16 season magically got better at defense.  It is simply that Johnson went from a bad defensive team to a good defensive team.

Also, on a quick google search of Crabbe, RipCityProject.com had a completely year end review of Crabbe's defense.  https://ripcityproject.com/2017/05/20/allen-crabbe-prove-worth/  claiming Crabbe played good defense, provided clips of this (and he looked good in these brief highlights), and noted that Crabbe would regularly guard the opposing team's best perimeter player.  Similarly I have seen other articles reference Crabbe as a good defender.  https://hardwoodhoudini.com/2017/07/27/silent-deadly-boston-celtics/ - also, just looking at certain Blazer's forum several fans do think he is a solid defender. 

Anyway, it made me feel a lot better with the situation and Crabbe may not be a terrible defender that has been made out.  Figured I'd share.

GoNets,"D’Angelo Russell Q&amp;A about Jordi Fernandez behind the scenes, how Fernandez is similar to former Nets coach Kenny Atkinson, his desire to re-sign with the Nets &amp; more","https://preview.redd.it/cm8yq414g4oe1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed35ab10778116f43c5714377fe1d09acc4c5cda

Following Brooklyn’s 111-108 win over the Los Angeles Lakers at Barclays Center, Nets guard **D’Angelo Russell** spoke with HoopsHype about coach **Jordi Fernandez** behind the scenes, how Fernandez is similar to former Nets coach **Kenny Atkinson**, his desire to re-sign with the Nets in free agency, his experience with the Lakers, **Austin Reaves**, and more.



**Scotto: How would you describe your relationship with Jordi Fernandez behind the scenes?**

**D’Angelo Russell:** I just appreciate it more than anything because I’ve come from places where I don’t have that relationship. I’ve kind of just had success off of just showing up and no relationship. With **JJ (Redick)**, I had a solid relationship with him on the way out. I told Jordi today for him to trust me and allow me to be a basketball player and not just a shot maker. If my shots aren’t falling, he still trusts me to be out there to make plays. I respect that more than anything. I’ve been kind of categorized as a guy who only makes shots, but being a basketball player is my strength. For him to trust me so soon since I’ve been here, I’m nothing but appreciative.



**Scotto: How would you compare and contrast Jordi Fernandez to Kenny Atkinson?**

  
**Russell:** They’re both workers. I think that’s where their success comes from. I’ve always been a fan of anything that starts from the top and trickles down. It’s easier to send that message. We see him every day coming in here and working. We see countless amount of hours watching film and things like that. I think that’s where it starts. Kenny had that same hunger, so I’m not surprised he’s doing what he’s doing over there (with the Cleveland Cavaliers).



**Scotto: What have you tried to do on the court as a leader with a younger roster around you since you arrived in Brooklyn following the trade?**

  
**Russell:** I try to reiterate Jordi’s messages as much as I can. He speaks what he means. As a young group, it can go through one ear and out the other, so I try to be another voice on the team that can relay his message and lead by example.



**Scotto: What’s been different here for you in Brooklyn, where you’ve had success compared to other places?**

  
**Russell:** Team. I’ve been on so many different teams where the team’s not a priority. To be here, the team is everything from every aspect you can think of. It’s team-oriented. As a team, we win. As a team, we lose. To be engraved into that and just fit in is a good feeling.



**Scotto: What did it mean to you to return to Brooklyn?**

  
**Russell:** It’s great. I would never take it for granted, coming from where I came from. Obviously, I was a little traumatized there. To be here and get the opportunity to just be me where there’s familiarity as well is just icing on the cake. I’m at the point in my career where I’m not going out and scoring 25 points every night and wowing with numbers. It’s a point where I’m trying to gravitate towards doing it the right way, and how I can contribute to winning is my priority. He (Coach Fernandez) lets me do that. He trusts me already, so I can imagine getting to training camp for something like that and having that under my belt with the guys. I think the sky’s the limit.





**Scotto: Would you be open to returning next season as a Net?**

  
**Russell:** Yeah. Why wouldn’t I? I keep seeing stuff coming out. I’ll tell you. Heck yeah. I want to be wherever I’m at. I’m here. I love these guys. I appreciate this, and I would love to be back.



**Scotto: You’re also close with Austin Reaves, who you played against tonight. What have you seen from him since you departed in the trade for Dorian-Finney-Smith?**

  
**Russell:** His role has changed a little bit. He’s such a killer, and he’s so underrated. I don’t think that **LeBron (James)** or **Luka (Doncic)** can hinder his success or knock him off of how good he is. Kudos to him. I’m cheering for him.

GoNets,Thank you for the welcoming atmosphere - a depressed former Knicks Fan.,"Hey everyone. I just want to say thank you for accepting me and the other former Knicks fans. As a 24-year-old fan for well over a decade, this trade was just too much to handle. We all thought that the gross incompetence of the 2000's was a thing of the past, but clearly, Scott Perry and Steve Mills are perpetuating the ineptitude so synonymous with the Knicks. And I'm done. 

This nets team is beautiful, and I've been rooting for you guys since the rebuild. What this team has built is organic and inspiring. But I'm coming in relatively ignorant. Is there anything I should know as a new fan? 

PS Dlo/Dinwiddie were SNUBBED wtf is that.. ",53,23,2019-02-01,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/alx196/thank_you_for_the_welcoming_atmosphere_a/
GoNets,With the playoff race getting closer and closer it makes me reminisce..,"About how we threw away the pelicans game. Or how we choked that 20 pt lead to the Thunder. Or when we let the Cavs beat us. Or when we let the grizzlies come back up 7 with 45 seconds remaining. Or when we lead philly the whole game and we let Jimmy sink the game winner on us. And when Lou Will hit that ridiculous shot. Man we would be a lock for a playoff spot if it wasnt for these games we threw away(besides clippers game)

Then Again...

I also remember the surprising victory over the Raptors sparking a 7 game win streak. And the Rockets game where Dinwiddie unleashed his Inner T-Mac. Or the time when D’lo dropped the dagger on LA. Don’t forget when Levert dropped  game winners on the Nuggets and the Knicks. Sure as hell remember clamping the Pistons in a dominating fashion and getting a standing O from the crowd at the end of the first half and finally when D’lo absolutely demolished the Kings for the heroic victory.  

Man this season has been up and down but for what its has made us all more excited then ever about Nets Basketball and the future of our team. No matter how this season ends just remember that nobody expected anything from us this year, and now we are raising eyebrows around the league and more importantly amongst the most marquee free agents. How do you like that Billy King?",52,8,2019-03-26,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/b5uxvd/with_the_playoff_race_getting_closer_and_closer/
GoNets,The Story of the Brooklyn Nets Rebuild 2014-2018,"On July 13, 2014 Paul Pierce left the Nets to sign with the Washington Wizards, effectively ending Brooklyn’s short tenure as an NBA playoff team / overpriced fringe contender.

During the 2014 summer Brooklyn didn’t really do much. The team didn’t have any draft picks but they bought three second round picks and took Cory Jefferson, Markel Brown and Xavier Thames. also made a three team trade with Boston and Cleveland which sent out Marcus Thornton and two euro stash players who have never come over. They brought back Jarrett Jack and Sergey Karasev. I guess that trade was a win? Jack was a steady but unspectacular point guard for them for two years. Karasev is out of the league now. 

The Nets also brought over Bojan Bogdanovic and signed Alan Anderson during the summer of 2014. Anderson played two years in brooklyn, appearing in 152 games, starting 45. He was pretty bad, his PER hovered around 10. Bojan provided solid but unspectacular volume scoring for two and a half years before being traded to the Wizards at the 2017 deadline (for a lottery protected first (became Jarrett Allen), andrew nicholson and the return of marcus thornton).

At the 2015 trade deadline the nets sent Kevin Garnett back home to Minnesota in exchange for Thaddeus Young. This was awesome. Good trade for both sides, Young went on to opt out that summer and re-sign with the Nets for four years, 54 million. Not a great contract for a rebuilding team although Young played a lot, tried hard and kept them semi-respectable during the 2015-16 season before being dealt to Indiana the following summer for a first round pick (became Caris LeVert). 

On draft night 2015, the Nets traded Mason Plumlee and Pat Connaughton to Portland for Steve Blake and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. This was a good move, Hollis-Jefferson has shown more promise than Connaughton and Mason Plumlee later received a huge contract from the Denver Nuggets. 

The Nets took Chris McCullough with the 29th pick in the first round. McCullough was sent to the Wizards in the Bojan Bogdanovic trade at the 2015 deadline. The wizards declined his fourth year team option, it seems unlikely that McCullough has an NBA future. 

Rondae Hollis-Jefferson is currently the longest tenured Brooklyn Net, despite being only 23 years old. Hollis-Jefferson has played heavy minutes for the team the past three years, alternating between starter and bench roles. He’s a hybrid 3/4 , at least ideally, but his ceiling is inherently limited by the fact that he can’t shoot at all. RHJ has one year left on his rookie deal, it will interesting to see what his market is like next summer. 

Nets legend Brook Lopez opted out and became a free agent during the summer of 2015. The leading scorer in franchise history re-signed with the Nets for three years, 60 million. Lopez was later traded to the Lakers in 2017.  

On July 11, 2015 they waived former superstar Deron Williams. They bought out Williams’ final two years for approximately 25 million even though he was still owed two years, 43.5. This seems like a good move although it also speaks to how unattractive playing for the Brooklyn Nets was at the time. A guy gave up almost twenty million just to get out of there. The Nets used the stretch provision on Williams, meaning that he will count as $5.5 million of dead cap money every year until 2019-2020. 

The Nets’ final move in the summer of 2015 was to sign former number one pick Andrea Bargnani to a minimum deal that was two years with a partial guarantee for the second year. They bought him out of this deal in February 2016, 2 days after the hiring of Sean Marks. Bargnani has not played in the NBA since. 

On January 10, 2016, Billy King was fired from his job as general manager but for some reason continued to consult Nets ownership as they searched for his replacement. At least that’s what Woj reported when they fired him. 

Whatever search process the team used must have worked fine because the Nets hired retired NBA player and Spurs assistant GM Sean Marks on February 18, 2016. The Nets almost immediately waived Bargnani and then made moves to buy out Joe Johnson. Joe Johnson only gave up about three million so clearly he didn’t want to get out of there even close to as badly as former backcourt mate Deron Williams. 

Marks then used the roster spot vacated by Johnson to sign Sean Kilpatrick, who played on two 10 day contracts before signing a multiple year deal on March 19, 2016. Kilpatrick was in the Nets rotation during the 16-17 season but was ultimately waived in December 2017. 

The Nets only selection in the 2016 draft was Marcus Paige, who they took with the 25th pick of the 2nd round. They traded Paige and cash to the Jazz for Isaiah Whitehead. Somewhat similar to Kilpatrick, Whitehead was a fringe NBA guard who averaged 22 minutes per game for the nets during the 2016-17 season. Whitehead is still on the Nets although he played considerably less this past year, making frequent trips to the G League’s Long Island Nets. 

On June 30, 2016, failing to find a good trade partner, the Nets declined Jarrett Jack’s player option. Jack tweeted a laughing emoji that afternoon.   

Markel Brown, Wayne Ellington, Sergey Karasev, Shane Larkin, Willie Reed, Thomas Robinson, Henry Sims and Donald Sloan all became free agents after the 2015-16 season and none of them returned to the Nets. 

The Nets were active during the summer of 2016, signing Jeremy Lin to a multiple year deal, and Allen Crabbe and Tyler Johnson to poison pill offer sheets that were matched by Portland and Miami respectively. All of these contracts were overpays, in no doubt influenced by Brooklyn’s hopeless franchise position and in the cases of Crabbe and Johnson their attempts to lure restricted free agents with their ample cap space. The Nets knew they were going to have to pay a ‘Nets tax’, and they were mostly fine with it. 

Jeremy Lin’s deal was 3 years, 36 million. Lin has only played 37 games in two years since signing that contract, hopefully he’ll be healthy this upcoming season. 

In July of 2016 the Nets traded Thaddeus Young to the Pacers for Caris Levert. Levert has appeared in 128 games for the Nets these past two seasons and has shown potential as a scoring wing. 

They also added Justin Hamilton, Greivis Vasquez, Luis Scola, Anthony Bennett, Randy Foye, Joe Harris and Yogi Ferrell during the 2016 offseason and exercised team options on Chris McCullough and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. 

At the 2017 trade deadline the Nets made their Bojan Bogdanovic trade mentioned above. This deal sent Bogdanovic and McCullough to the Wizards for Nicholson, Thornton and a lottery protected first. 

During the 2017 Draft the Nets selected Jarrett Allen with the 22nd pick that they received from Indiana in the Bogdanovic trade. Allen probably has the most trade value of anyone on the Nets, having displayed ability as a raw rim runner and shot blocker during his rookie season. 

On draft night the Nets dealt Brook Lopez and the draft rights to Kyle Kuzma (27th pick, from Boston as part of Pierce, KG trade) to the Lakers in exchange for Timofey Mozgov and D’Angelo Russell. Mozgov has a gargantuan contract (4 years, 64 million signed during the summer of 2016) and the Nets expect him to be nothing more than a serviceable bench big. They willingly took on Mozgov’s contract in exchange for rolling the dice with D-Lo, the #2 pick in the 2015 draft. Russell was disappointing during his first year with the Nets but is still very young (entering age 22 season) and has high potential as a scoring combo guard. 

The Nets continued to stay busy during the summer of 2017, suggesting a strategic shift towards accepting overpaid, ‘bad’ contracts of guys who were at least able to be solid contributors and rotation players. Entering their final year without a first round pick from the infamous Boston trade, the Nets had no reason to try to be as bad as possible and had plenty of cap space, having been completely unattractive to free agents for years. 

They signed Otto Porter to a max offer sheet which the Wizards matched. 

On July 13, 2017 the Nets traded Justin Hamilton to the Raptors for DeMarre Carroll and his contract (2 years, 30 million remaining at the time) along with Toronto’s 2018 first and a conditional second. 

Carroll started 73 games for the Nets last year and provided at least a decent facsimile of good three and D play. He’s obviously not worth his contract but may have slight trade value this year now that he’s on an expiring deal and could potentially help a good team. 

A year after matching their offer sheet, the Trail Blazers dealt Allen Crabbe to the Nets for Andrew Nicholson, basically a pure salary dump for Portland. This trade has worked out reasonably well for the Nets because Crabbe was solid this year and again may have some value to a good team because of his ability to hit catch and shoot threes. 

On December 7, 2017 the Nets traded Trevor Booker to the Sixers for disappointing lottery picks Jahlil Okafor, Nik Stauskas and the Knicks’ 2019 second. This is the right kind of trade for a talent deprived team to make, buying low on guys who were once highly valued. But neither Okafor nor Stauskas was able to contribute much this past year. Stauskas was better, he at least shot 40% on 7.5 threes per 36 minutes. Okafor was one of the worst rotation bigs in the league and the Nets hemorrhaged points with him on the floor. 

At the 2018 trade deadline the Nets only moves were to send Tyler Zeller to Milwaukee in exchange for a second round pick (the 45th pick in this year’s draft) and Rashad Vaughn, who they then traded to New Orleans for Dante Cunningham. This is a good, minor move which ended up yielding a decently useful second.

As it stands the Nets most valuable future assets are Jarrett Allen and their 2019 first round pick. D’angelo Russell, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Caris Levert all have solid potential but it’s easy to imagine them being moved if the right deal came along. 

I would like to see the team explore Spencer Dinwiddie trades, given his unexpected success last season and the team’s glut of guards. Dinwiddie could be a nice bench piece on a good team but has no long term future in Brooklyn. Jeremy Lin could also fetch something at next year’s trade deadline if he is able to get healthy and rehab his value at the start of this year. 

Demarre Carroll and Allen Crabbe are overpaid but they aren’t completely dead salary. These guys could be sent to a good team in exchange for some worse contracts and a future asset. Think Gorgui Dieng or Ian Mahinmi and a lightly protected future first. 

It would be nice to see the Nets re-sign Joe Harris this summer if his price tag is reasonable. However, it’s easy to imagine a contender falling in love with Harris, given his three point stroke and expected affordability. 

Overall one has to feel that the Nets have done close to the best they possibly could have given the circumstances that the Boston trade left them in. Very excited to see what Sean Marks can with a full asset base moving forward.

GoNets,Regarding fans at the Barclays…,"Like others, I was definitely bummed out listening to that podcast Mikal was on.

I know it’s been sounding and feeling bad being at the games hearing fans from other teams drown us out. But even before KD and Kyrie there was a really good atmosphere that proves a good product and a hard working team gives Nets fans the right energy and reasons to show up.

Been a fan since ‘01 as a kid in Jersey, but eventually moved to NYC as many do around here. I first joined the BK Block in 2018-2019, and the first 20 or so games were miserable. We were basically on a 10 game losing streak at one point and we had to shout over fans from every other team every night. Somehow even Jazz fans outnumbered us one night which was insane. But then the magic of that year started brewing after that players-only meeting. All of a sudden D’Lo and Caris started playing at an all-star level. Jarret Allen was becoming a force. Rondae and Theo started busting moves on the bench. Game by game you saw more and more Nets fans come back. The whole team was fun to watch and always hustled and grinded, even though many nights we were outmatched on talent.

I vividly remember a game against the  Blake Griffin-led Pistons, and if we won it we clinched a playoff seed. I’ve never heard the place so loud that entire season. The whole arena was on their feet for the last possession of the first half because we were absolutely killing them. 

All the way until the playoffs, we had that same energy in the arena. It was amazing. Even that home game 3 vs Philly in the first round was insane. 

The Knicks have definitely gone through periods where it was just as  miserable to go to games as a fan, although a lot less painful than us in BK considering how many fans they have/how long the team has been there. Their fans can deny that all they want, but my dad is a Knick fan and we would go to games when they sucked, and there were several times fans of other teams drowned out the  Knick fans. Now, they (NYK) have a lot of parallels to the 18-19 Nets, just a better version. 

Sadly, I can’t go to as many games since I’ve moved a bit further away :( But we’ll get back there soon. Just need guys who will go out there and give it their all, and a coach that continually inspires and demands that out of them.

- Pigeon. They’re afraid of nothing, lots of opportunity.

GoNets,"[Analysis] Despite the loss to OKC, some of the Nets had good moments. That and looking at stats during the Nets losing streak","Even with the losing streak continuing at the hands of the OKC Thunder, multiple Nets players had good (and bad) moments during the game that can provide some happiness for fans, I think.

**First off, Rodions**

In yesterday's game, Rodions played pretty well on both ends in limited minutes. In my opinion, he should been playing in the overtime over Temple, but I digress. Any who, while everyone (including myself) makes note of Rodi's early struggles and refusal to shoot open threes, something he has shown improvement on during his play this year is his passing. 

[First, Rodi drives baseline and throws a nice one handed pass on the move to JA who dunks (or aggressively lays it up) all over Muscala](https://streamable.com/qwfet). 

[Kurucs gets the pass from Dinwiddie, drives toward the middle and passes it off to JA for the dunk to avoid the charge](https://streamable.com/6squr). Might be me, but I think if this was last year's Rodi, this would of probably been a charge and OKC's ball.

[Rodi hits JA with another one handed pass on his drive attempt, JA passes it back, Rodi recognizes that he has CP3 and Bazley (Prince's man) in front of him, and passes it back out to Prince for an open three.](https://streamable.com/zxfjq) Good recognition on Rodi's part.

Even when Rodi providing much offensively, he can provide respectable defense. He had pretty good moments guarding OKC's three guards. 

[Here we see Rodi doing a good job getting over the Adams screen by avoiding contact, gets back in the play, and Dennis forces a difficult shot for a miss](https://streamable.com/wmvvf)

[Even though this isn't the CP3 of old, he's still crafty and a great ball wizard who can fool anyone. Rodi doesn't fall for the CP3 wizardry, gets over the Adams screen again, and the possession ends in a Adams travel.](https://streamable.com/9chjz)

[Rodi follows SGA around, who can't get decent separation on the step back, and ends up settling for a long three that misses] (https://streamable.com/zf1lj).

After the abysmal start to the season, Rodi seems to be finding his footing slowly. Hopefully it continues, since he's been one of the few bright spots during this losing streak.

**Jarrett Allen**

While Jarrett Allen's offensive production has diminished along with the rest of the offense for the last month, he's still one of the best rim protectors in the league. And this season, we're starting to see Allen defend guards on the perimeter with more success.

[CP3 iso's JA at the top of the three point line, but JA stays with him and he's forced to pass to SGA. Rodi ends the possession playing good defense and forcing SGA into a touch shot](https://streamable.com/vykfw)

[Again, JA is switched onto CP3, but CP3 can't get by him and is forced to pass](https://streamable.com/7396g)

[SGA gets JA on a switch, but misses the rim completely on the layup attempt due to JA's defense and length](https://streamable.com/cuu5d)

Even outside of switches, JA is still a deterrent at the rim. 

[In transition, CP3 pushes the ball, but gets nothing. He tries to pass the ball to SGA for what would of been an open three because Prince is too far away, but gets denied because JA blocks the pass. Then JA makes his way into the paint to for a huge block on Ferguson](https://streamable.com/dbujy).

[Another example of JA's length bother opposing players. SGA has an open layup, but Allen comes off Adams to protect the rim and SGA misses the tough layup over JA's outstretched arm](https://streamable.com/h023o). 

Outside of JA's defensive prowess, he made multiple nice passes in yesterday's game.

[After setting the screen for Dinwiddie, JA gets the ball on the rim dive, spins, and hits Prince for a open three that goes in](https://streamable.com/hvapj)

[After slipping the screen, JA gets the ball from Dinwiddie. He feels / notices Bazley to his left and throws the ball to Prince for a wide open three](https://streamable.com/j07kr)

[After a horrible Dinwiddie miss, Allen is able to hit Prince in the corner for three that misses after being surrounded by three players](https://streamable.com/j52kz).


**Taurean Prince**

While Prince finally had a good shooting performance, there's still a lot left to desire on the defensive end.

[On this play, Prince helps off of Bazley in the corner too much to protect the rim when JA is right there to cover for Kurucs, giving Bazley an open three that he makes](https://streamable.com/pi15u)

[Prince closes out to Bazley, but he has his hands at his sides the entire time and gives up the drive to the right and has to foul](https://streamable.com/1q81k)

[Off a miss, Prince is caught ball watching and helping way too much off of Ferguson, giving him an open three that he makes](https://streamable.com/sbhm0)

[Again, Prince gets caught ball watching on the CP3 drive, leaving Dennis open for a three](https://streamable.com/4c2et)

**Miscellaneous** 

LeVert had [two](https://streamable.com/gzjgj) [nice](https://streamable.com/xuwvb) passes to DJ during the game. Glad to see him back on the court. 

[I have no idea why GT threw this lob pass to DJ when he had a wide open layup, but it worked out](https://streamable.com/eg9mn)

[This is not a shot the Nets need GT taking right now](https://streamable.com/20i7p)

**Some stats**

***First, good stats:*** 

For the season, the Nets are 14th in DEFRTG. In December, the Nets ranked 3rd in DEFRTG at 104.2, behind only the Bucks and Bulls(???).  In the last 15 games, they are second behind the bucks. Since Christmas, they're ranked 7th in DEFRTG. 

Opponents have averaged 45 points in the paint (PITP) vs. the Nets this season, good for 8th. From Dec. 1st until January 9th, opponents have averaged 42 PITP, good for second behind the bucks. Opponents shot 58% in the restricted area vs. the Nets, good for third, behind the bucks and raptors. Since Christmas, they're basically tied with the Jazz for second at 56%. 

***Next, the bad:*** 

For the season, the Nets are shooting 59% in the restricted area (RA), tied for 4th worst with the Raptors. The Nets shoot the most shots in the paint of any team this season. Since Christmas, they're shooting 53%, tied with the Bulls for worst in the league.

The Nets are also shooting 33% from three, tied for third worst in the league. They average the 6th most attempts in the league. During the losing streak, they are shooting a league worse 29.7% from three on 40.9 attempts per game. The 40.9 attempts is tied for third highest attempts. 

The Nets OFFRTG on the season is ranked 24 at 105.3, but during the losing streak it is dead last at 95.5(!!!!) 

Digging into some player numbers, you get [this shitty chart that I made in excel.](https://i.imgur.com/LedvHGf.png)

Some notables:

* Dinwiddie is shooting SEVEN PERCENT (THIS IS NOT A TYPO) ON PULL UP THREES DURING THE LOSING STREAK. All of them are shooting horribly on pulls up during this streak, but god damn.
* The league average FG% in the RA is around 57%. Prince's FG% in the RA dropping from 57 in 2018-19 to 40 19-20 is very note worthy. Temple's drop in FG% in the RA is also note worthy. 
* Caris's drop in FG% in the RA feels accurate just watching, he forces a lot of shots at times and [he gets poor results.](https://streamable.com/x7coo) 

All of this to say, the Nets defense has been surprisingly pretty good given the personnel, but the offensive has been a dumpster fire. People are screaming at Kenny to make adjustments, but I don't think you can make an adjustment for people missing their threes *this badly.* There's going to be variance in shooting performances in small samples sizes, but these number are horrendously bad.

**NEW YORK** \-- Don’t tell the[ Brooklyn Nets](https://www.nj.com/nets/) they’re supposed to be tanking for Duke’s [Cooper Flagg](https://www.nj.com/sports/2024/02/cooper-flagg-wasnt-born-a-basketball-star-in-fact-the-nations-top-prospect-was-lucky-to-have-been-born-at-all.html) or [Rutgers ](https://www.nj.com/rutgersbasketball/)stars [Ace Bailey](https://www.nj.com/rutgersbasketball/2024/10/nba-scouts-react-to-ace-baileys-rutgers-debut-he-will-challenge-cooper-for-no-1.html) and[ Dylan Harper.](https://www.nj.com/rutgersbasketball/2024/11/dylan-harper-relishes-dominant-rutgers-debut-dream-come-true.html)

“We don’t use some of those words \[like ‘tanking’\], so it’s go compete, go compete and let the chips fall where they may,” Nets GM Sean Marks told [NJ.com](http://nj.com/) in an exclusive interview before the Nets lost to the [Knicks](https://www.nj.com/knicks/), 124-122, in an NBA Cup game Friday night at Madison Square Garden. The Nets trailed by 21 points in the third quarter but took the lead in the final seconds before Jalen Brunson hit a game-winning 3-pointer.

When Brooklyn dealt [Mikal Bridges](https://www.nj.com/sports/2024/06/knicks-go-all-in-on-nba-title-run-by-trading-for-4th-villanova-star-in-mikal-bridges-i-bring-winning-to-your-team.html) to the rival Knicks in a blockbuster summer trade that brought back four first-round picks, including one in next summer’s star-driven NBA Draft, it was widely understood that [the Nets were trying to “Wave the White Flagg for Cooper Flagg](https://www.nj.com/nets/2024/10/cooper-flagg-could-trigger-brooklyn-nets-rebuild-through-draft-thats-how-you-end-up-with-tatum-and-brown.html).”

Entering the 2024-25 NBA season, the Nets were No. 1 on [Tankathon.com](https://tankathon.com/) in terms of odds to land the No. 1 pick, which could be Flagg, the uber-talented 6-foot-9 Duke freshman, but also could be the 6-10 Bailey, who scored 17 points, including a highlight-reel dunk, in his Rutgers debut Friday night.

The over/under on the Nets win total was 19.5, per Vegas oddsmakers.

But under first-year coach Jordi Fernandez, the Nets (5-8) are competing hard and and would be in the mix for the Play-In Tournament if the postseason started today. Which, of course, it does not.

Even when they lose, they are competitive. They led the reigning NBA champion Boston Celtics by 13 points on Wednesday before losing, 139-114.

Against the Knicks, Cam Thomas poured in 43 points and Dennis Schröder hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 11.5 seconds left before Brunson’s game-winner.

“Credit my guys, we talked about continuing to believe and fight and fight together,” Fernandez said. “Even though we were down 18 in the fourth, we kept fighting and we found a way. And we didn’t stop fighting.”

He added: “Losing hurts, and it hurts to all of us. Right there we showed our identity, and nobody can take that away from us. Nobody.”

After the loss, the Nets were projected to draft at No. 8, with [Tankathon](https://tankathon.com/mock_draft) projecting they will 7-foot-2 Duke freshman big man [Khaman Maluach](https://www.nj.com/sports/2024/07/a-17-year-old-duke-freshman-is-living-his-dream-at-the-paris-olympics-and-hes-being-coached-by-a-nj-legend.html) \-- not Flagg or Bailey.

“I think you navigate the season as it goes, and you don’t go into a season saying this is where we’re going to be, this is how it’s going to end,” Marks said outside the visiting locker room at the Garden. “There’s a lot of unforeseen things.”

He added: “You’ve gotta give credit to these players, they’re playing with a chip on their shoulder, the coaches are doing a helluva job, so that’s exciting to see. It’s exciting to see an identity being formed and a culture being driven. So who am I to push back on that?”

Marks, of course, is doing his due diligence ahead of what’s expected to be a potentially historic draft next summer.

After the Bridges trade, the Nets now have 15 first-round picks over the next seven years, including four in 2025.

“This year specifically, with all the picks that we have, we have to be scouting a very wide range,” Marks said. “And that’s fine, that’s exciting, we’ve never had that opportunity before.”

The highest pick the Nets have had since Marks became GM in 2016 was No. 17 in 2019, which they used on Nickeil Alexander-Walker, who was promptly traded and ended up in New Orleans.

The Nets haven’t had a lottery pick since choosing Derrick Favors at No. 3 in 2010. Favors has been out of the NBA for three years.

Ahead of next year’s draft, Marks has attended multiple Rutgers’ games, including the preseason exhibition with Rick Pitino’s St. John’s club where both Marks and Nets assistant GM B.J. Johnson were in attendance on a night when Bailey and Harper combined for 45 points.

After that game, one NBA scout said of Bailey: “He’s \[among the\] top-3 youth players in the world. Everyone has Cooper Fever, \[but\] he will challenge Cooper for No. 1.

“It’s not clear cut.”

There’s still a long way to go in this NBA season -- and an even longer time before the draft.

A lot can happen.

The Nets could go into a tailspin and emerge with one of the top picks in the draft. Adam Silver could end up announcing Flagg or Bailey or Harper to the Nets on draft night.

But for now, the Nets are competing and could end up in the mix for a playoff spot, in which case they’d miss out on potential franchise-changing players like Flagg or Bailey.

  
“Well, these guys \[on the Nets\] have done something really right if that’s the case,” Marks said, “and I love that.”

GoNets,"Piston Fan Jumping Ship, Joining the Nets For 2021","The ownership/Front Office in Detroit is broken, so I was searching for a new team to follow closely this year. I pretty quickly narrowed it down to Brooklyn or Atlanta and decided to follow Bruce Brown to Brooklyn.

I hope that you'll allow an out-of-towner to join your crew.

Bruce Brown, btw, is the most underrated player the NBA. In fact, he is a genuinely EXCELLENT player. Not good, but excellent. He's the Nets missing piece. I expect that before long, he'll be logging 30 minutes a night, even in a crowded situation.

Bruce Brown can break down a defense off the dribble and get to the basket at will (seriously!!). He's an excellent shovel passer in tight quarters near the rim. He's learned to shoot the corner 3. He's an intense defender, an agitator that enjoys annoying the opposition.

And how Detroit traded him for a pile of poo is indefensible. So, I got out of a ""bad marriage.""

Watching the Nets climb out of the abyss to where they are today has been stunning. I'm looking forward to watching them contend for the title.

GoNets,22 Days Until Brooklyn Basketball. #22 Caris LeVert.,"Young Caris coming into the season with a lot of hope and expectation - lets show him some love for his third season as a Net!

&amp;#x200B;

Wiki: Caris Coleman LeVert (born August 25, 1994) is an American professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Michigan Wolverines. As a freshman for the 2012–13 team, he nearly redshirted but earned a key role off the bench as the team went on to reach the championship game in the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. As a sophomore for the 2013–14 team, he became a regular starter and was selected as a second team 2013–14 All-Big Ten player for the outright Big Ten regular season champions. His junior and senior seasons were interrupted by injury. LeVert is a cousin of Eddie Levert, Gerald Levert and Sean Levert.

&amp;#x200B;

LeVert grew up in Northeast Columbus but moved to nearby Pickerington in second grade. One of his teammates at Pickerington High School Central was future Ohio State forward Jae'Sean Tate. As a high school senior, he led Pickerington Central to a 26–2 record and the 2012 OHSAA Division I state championship. LeVert was a 2012 Associated Press All-Ohio Second Team high school basketball player and the 2012 Columbus Dispatch Metro Player of the Year for Pickerington High School Central. He was not heavily recruited in high school and his only official visit was to Alabama State. He committed to play basketball for John Groce and the Ohio Bobcats men's basketball program in November 2011. Meanwhile, when future teammates Mitch McGary and Nik Stauskas joined Glenn Robinson III by committing to Michigan in November 2011, Michigan became the fifth best recruiting class in the country.

&amp;#x200B;

When Groce got hired by Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball in March 2012, LeVert got lost in the shuffle and decided to commit to Michigan. Ironically, Groce's 2011–12 Ohio Bobcats' upset of the 2011–12 Michigan team in the 2012 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament was probably the reason that Groce was hired by Illinois and LeVert withdrew his National Letter of Intent to play for Ohio.

&amp;#x200B;

The 2011–12 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team had been co-champions of 2011–12 Big Ten Conference, but lost both of its co-captains, Zack Novak and Stu Douglass, to graduation and three players as transfers. The team was returning a nucleus of All-Big Ten players Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway, Jr.

&amp;#x200B;

LeVert arrived at Michigan weighing 152 pounds (68.9 kg). As a freshman, he began the year behind Stauskas, Robinson, Tim Hardaway, Jr., and Matt Vogrich on the depth chart for the shooting guard/small forward positions and did not play in the first six games as a result. LeVert was a part of an incoming class that included McGary, Stauskas, Robinson, and Spike Albrecht. Eventually, Michigan head coach John Beilein decided that LeVert had value as a perimeter defender and decided to play him rather than redshirt him. On December 1 against Bradley Beilein juggled his lineup: Stauskas made his first career regular season start and LeVert saw his first action. By late December, LeVert became the one-on-one partner for Burke after practices. LeVert made his first start on December 29 against Central Michigan, when Tim Hardaway, Jr. was unavailable. The 3 freshmen in the starting lineup—Robinson, Stauskas and LeVert—combined for 48 points, 12 rebounds and 8 assists. That night LeVert tallied 9 points and 5 assists. LeVert averaged 2.3 points in under 11 minutes of play per game. He never scored in double digits as a freshman, but he scored 8 points each in conference wins over Illinois and Michigan State as well as the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament final four victory over Syracuse in 21 minutes of play.

&amp;#x200B;

LeVert's classmates all made names for themselves as freshmen. During the Spring and Summer semesters (the offseason) of 2013 LeVert and Stauskas trained together on the court and in the weight room. He followed fellow Columbus native and National Player of the Year Burke as a key contributor to Michigan basketball as a sophomore. After opening the season with career-highs of 17 points and 5 rebounds on November 8 against UMass Lowell, he posted 24 points on November 12 against South Carolina State. When Michigan played (#10 AP Poll/ #8 Coaches' Poll) Duke in the ACC–Big Ten Challenge on December 3, LeVert again posted 24 points, including a 7–7 free throw performance. On January 18, Michigan defeated (#3 AP/#3 Coaches) Wisconsin at the Kohl Center for the first time since the 1998–99 team did so on February 27, 1999. It was the highest ranked team Michigan has ever beaten on the road. LeVert contributed a career-high 4 steals and 20 points. LeVert posted his first double double on January 30 at home against Purdue with a career-high 11 rebounds and 14 points. On February 16, Michigan lost to (#21/21) Wisconsin, despite a career-high 25 points from LeVert. Michigan clinched its first outright (unshared) Big Ten Conference championship since 1985–86. He was a 2014 second team 2013–14 All-Big Ten selection (coaches and media). On March 11 LeVert was named to the all-District V (OH, IN, IL, MI, MN, WI) team by the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA). The 2013–14 team was eliminated in the elite eight round of the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament by Kentucky. LeVert and teammate Stauskas, joined Julius Randle, Aaron Harrison and Marcus Lee on the All-Midwest Regional team.

&amp;#x200B;

On May 12, LeVert underwent surgery to repair a stress fracture in his foot. He was expected to be sidelined for 8–10 weeks, but be available for the team's August trip to play in Europe. LeVert returned to action just before the team's August 15–24 10-day, 4-game trip to Italy.

&amp;#x200B;

Prior to the 2014–15 season, LeVert was named a first team All-Big Ten preseason selection along with Frank Kaminsky, Yogi Ferrell, Terran Petteway, and Sam Dekker.\[49\] LeVert was selected by [NBCSports.com](https://NBCSports.com) to its Preseason All-American first team, by SB Nation,\[50\] Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook,\[51\] Athlon Sports,\[52\] Bleacher Report,\[53\] Sports Illustrated,\[54\] and [CBSSports.com](https://CBSSports.com) to their second teams and by USA Today to its third team.\[55\]\[56\]\[57\] In its preseason top 100 player ranking, LeVert was listed at number 13 by ESPN.\[58\] He was also listed as a John R. Wooden Award Preseason Top 50 candidate.\[59\] LeVert also was named to the Oscar Robertson Trophy Watch List on November 24.\[60\] He was also included in the early December Naismith Award top 50 watch list.\[61\]

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

LeVert was named co-captain of the team along with Spike Albrecht. He opened the season with 9 assists against Hillsdale College on November 15, surpassing his previous career-high of five. On November 24, against Oregon, LeVert established a career high by making 11 free throws helping the team to a 70–63 victory in the Legends Classic semifinal game. He posted a career-high 32 points and tied a career-high 4 steals on December 6 in an upset loss to NJIT. He posted 4 steals again against Minnesota on January 10. On January 17 against Northwestern, he reinjured the foot that he had had surgery on the prior May and was lost for the season. At the time of his injury, LeVert led Michigan in scoring (14.9), rebounds (4.9), assists (3.7), steals (1.7) and minutes (35.8). LeVert was on crutches until early March and in a protective walking boot until early April.

&amp;#x200B;

LeVert had been expected to be a 2015 NBA Draft selection, but following his injury some felt his draft stock was impaired. Following the season, he sought advice from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee, but decided that he needed a second evaluation from them as the field of declared underclassmen became more clear with the thinking that ""I don't think it really makes sense to (leave school) early and get drafted in the second round"". On April 21, LeVert announced that he would return for his senior season. According to [CBSSports.com](https://CBSSports.com)'s Sam Vecenie, this would give LeVert a chance to improve his pick and roll decision making, his midrange offensive game and his defense, especially against screens.

&amp;#x200B;

Prior to the 2015–16 season, LeVert was named an All-Big Ten preseason selection, for the second straight year. LeVert became the fourth Wolverine to earn the award multiple times in their career, following Maurice Taylor, LaVell Blanchard and Manny Harris. He was also one of five All-Big Ten preseason selections according to the Big Ten Network. He was one of three Big Ten selections to the 20-man Jerry West Award preseason watchlist (along with James Blackmon, Jr. and Rasheed Sulaimon) announced by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He was an Athlon Sports Preseason All-American 3rd team selection. In preseason top 100 player rankings LeVert was ranked 16 by ESPN and 23 by NBC Sports. He made the initial 50-man John R. Wooden Award watch list on November 17. On December 2, Levert earned recognition on the 50-man Naismith College Player of the Year watchlist and 33-man Robertson Trophy watchlists.

&amp;#x200B;

After being sidelined for the final 14 games of the prior season for the 2014–15 Wolverines, LeVert began the season with a game-high 18 points and 5 assists as a starter against Northern Michigan. On November 16 against Elon, LeVert tied his career high with four steals. On December 5 against Houston Baptist, LeVert made his first start at point guard while Derrick Walton sat out due to a sprained ankle and posted 25 points and 8 rebounds. On December 8, Michigan lost 82–58 to (19/-) SMU as LeVert slumped on 1–13 field goal shooting and 3–6 free throw shooting. On December 15 against Northern Kentucky, LeVert posted 13 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, becoming the fourth player in Michigan program history to record a triple-double, and the 49th Wolverine to eclipse 1,000 career points. Based on his triple double against Northern Kentucky and a 19-point effort against Youngstown State, LeVert earned Co-Big Ten Player of the Week honors (along with Malcolm Hill) on December 21. On December 30, Michigan defeated Illinois 78–68 in its Big Ten Conference opener as LeVert posted a 22-point, 10-assist double-double. LeVert missed the January 2 game against Penn State with a lower left leg injury. At the time, he was the team leader in points, rebounds and assists.

&amp;#x200B;

On January 13, LeVert was one of four Big Ten athletes (along with Melo Trimble, Jarrod Uthoff and Denzel Valentine) among the 25 players included in the Wooden Award Midseason Top 25 Watch List. On the eve of LeVert's sixth missed game, head coach Beilein finally clarified that LeVert's left leg injury was not related to the two previous left foot stress fractures that LeVert had endured. On February 2, LeVert was one of two Big Ten athletes (along with Malcolm Hill) named one of 10 finalists for the Jerry West Award, despite having missed the last 8 of Michigan's 22 games. On February 10, Brendan F. Quinn of [MLive.com](https://MLive.com) broke the story that LeVert had been cleared to play. On February 13, Michigan defeated (#18/16) Purdue 61–56 with LeVert recording five rebounds and one assist in 11 minutes after missing the previous 11 games. On March 1, the team announced that the injury would end LeVert's season and collegiate career. On March 22, LeVert had a third surgical procedure in 22 months performed on his left foot in New York City by specialist Dr. Martin O'Malley. By late April, the draft stock of LeVert had slipped to the second round. According to the Michigan Basketball Twitter feed, he attended graduation in crutches at the end of April. He was invited to the May 11–15 NBA Draft Combine. While still on crutches at the combine, LeVert clarified that his injury was a Jones fracture of the fifth metatarsal and that Kevin Durant who has the same agency and used the same doctor had called to offer him encouragement.

&amp;#x200B;

The day before the 2016 NBA draft, LeVert authored an open letter to NBA general managers to assure them of his resiliency in the face of all of his doubters due to his injury.\[132\] On June 23, LeVert was selected with the 20th overall pick in the 2016 draft by the Indiana Pacers. He became Michigan's fifth first-round draft selection since 2013 and the fourth player drafted from Michigan's 2012 entering class.\[133\]\[134\] His rights were later traded to the Brooklyn Nets on July 7, in exchange for Thaddeus Young.\[135\] Dr. O'Malley, who had performed LeVert's most recent foot surgery, was on the Brooklyn Nets medical staff at the time of the trade.\[136\]\[137\] On July 14, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Nets.\[138\] LeVert missed the 2016 NBA Summer League as well as preseason and resumed practicing near the beginning of the regular season.\[139\] He began the season sidelined and still rehabbing his injury.\[140\] He was cleared to play on December 4.\[141\]\[142\] He made his professional debut on December 7 against the Denver Nuggets. Although he went 0-of-3 from the field, he posted 4 rebounds and 3 steals in 9 minutes of play, becoming the first Net to post 3 steals in his debut since Chris Childs in 1994. Levert entered at the start of the second quarter and posted 3 steals and 3 rebounds in 5:15 of play before halftime. LeVert scored his first NBA points on December 10 against the San Antonio Spurs on a back door reverse layup assisted by Brook Lopez. LeVert posted double digit scoring for the first time with 12 points on December 30 against the Washington Wizards and former Michigan one-on-one training partner Burke's season-high 27 points. On February 3, Levert made his first NBA start against former Michigan teammate Robinson and the Indiana Pacers. On April 6 against the Orlando Magic, LeVert posted his first 20-point performance. Despite missing a large portion of the season, LeVert almost made the NBA All-Rookie team, finishing 12 in the voting for the 10-man team.

&amp;#x200B;

When Jeremy Lin was sidelined for the 2017–18 NBA season after the first game, it opened up playing time. After Allen Crabbe started game 2, LeVert entered the starting lineup for game 3 on October 22 against the Atlanta Hawks, posting 16 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals. Coming off the bench on November 6 against the Phoenix Suns,he posted a 5-steal performance, while locking down Devin Booker so well that he frustrated Booker into fouling out. With injuries to point guards Jeremy Lin and D'Angelo Russell, coach Kenny Atkinson was impressed with LeVert rising to the challenge of learning a new position, earning the back-up point guard role to Spencer Dinwiddie. On December 7 (the first anniversary of his NBA debut), he had career highs in points (21) and assists (10) against reigning NBA MVP Russell Westbrook to lead the Nets to a 100–95 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder in Mexico City. Although his performance was highlighted by his first NBA double-double on offense, he was also praised for his 2-steal/2-block/5-rebound effort on defense against Westbrook. On December 27 against the New Orleans Pelicans, LeVert set another career high with 22 points. Two days later, he recorded 12 points and a career-high 11 assists in a 111–87 win over the Miami Heat. Then, LeVert had a few minor injuries (groin and knee) in January and February, that caused him to miss a total of 10 games over 3 separate stretches. On March 4, 2018, he had a 27-point effort in a 123–120 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. Levert posted a career-high 12 rebounds along with 19 points on March 31, against the Miami Heat.

&amp;#x200B;

LeVert is the son of Kim and Darryl LeVert and has one sibling, Darryl, who is his junior by 11 months. His mother is a Columbus City Schools first grade teacher. His father, who was a graphic designer, died on April 4, 2010 at the age of 46. As of February 2014, his brother, Darryl, played basketball for Connors State College. LeVert comes from a musical family as he is the third cousin of Eddie LeVert, the lead vocalist of the O'Jays. Eddie's sons include singers Gerald LeVert of LSG and LeVert (along with Sean LeVert).

GoNets,Shams: Rockets have no interest in Nets offer,"from his latest article on The Athletic 

&gt; The Rockets don’t have an urgency to move Harden and the franchise expects a mammoth package for the six-time All-NBA first team performer: along the lines of a young star and tremendous draft assets. *Sources said the Rockets have no interest in a Nets offer, unless it would include either Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving.* The 76ers want to view their two young All-Stars, Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid, under new head coach Doc Rivers — who has raved about both players and has privately made clear he wants the opportunity to have elevated success with both Simmons and Embiid — and centered around president of basketball operations Daryl Morey’s new acquisitions such as veteran shooters Danny Green and Seth Curry and key reserve center Dwight Howard. Rivers has spoken highly about the championship experience Howard and Green will provide after winning a title with the Los Angeles Lakers in October. In theory, however, Houston could wait out the potential availability of Simmons should Philadelphia get off to a slow start.

&gt;The 76ers and Nets remain at the top of Harden’s preferred destinations, sources said. Milwaukee and Miami represent two other East contenders.

so basically, It’s officially dead. The only chance the nets had of landing Harden was if Harden didn’t budge on his trade demand and scared everyone else away from trading for him.",45,36,2020-12-10,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/kag4su/shams_rockets_have_no_interest_in_nets_offer/
GoNets,Lakers fan here who stopped by earlier offering the discounted ticket for the section next to the visitors' tunnel. I had a really great experience cheering on the Nets,"I got to see Dlo and Dinwiddie play pretty good games (I thought he was gonna go for a career high when he scored the first 6 or 8 Nets points by himself). I love how Brooklyn played more team ball passing to everyone, which was a contrast to what the Wizards were doing. I appreciated Dlo vividly cheering on his team when he was not playing. 

I got Jared Dudley to acknowledge me at halftime when I yelled his name, and I was literally one person away trom shaking hands with Dlo (lucky guy). All in all, it was a great experience attending my very first Nets game. ",44,4,2018-11-17,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/9xsx53/lakers_fan_here_who_stopped_by_earlier_offering/
GoNets,Good amount of Nets alum playing in Puerto Rico.,"I used to watch other NBA games on League Pass when we had off-nights.  Now I just focus on the Nets and not much else around the league.  Instead I've been watching basketball from Puerto Rico on Youtube (Baloncesto Superior Nacional)  and a lot of familiar names, including some recent former Nets.  

Ed Davis, Mitch Creek, Jacob Wiley is looking like Nick Clax in the league.  Remember him? He was our first two-way player.  He plays for Bayamon, the team owned by Cardinals legend Yadier Molina.   
 Shabazz Napier was there earlier but went to Europe.  Even former Nets summer league invitee Brandon Knight is there.  

There's also Hassan Whiteside, Norris Cole, Tyreke Evans.  So the level of play is entertaining.   Crowds are into it and fun.  I'm enjoying it.  I just wanted to share about the former Nets doing their thing.",44,18,2023-04-07,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/12e5wed/good_amount_of_nets_alum_playing_in_puerto_rico/

GoNets,[OC] How the Celtics slowed down Kevin Durant in Game 1 (Analysis/Film Study),"Celtics vs Nets was the best first round series opener in recent memory. It may have been the best first round game in the last decade, opener or not. It came with a masterclass from Kyrie Irving, drama from the crowd, a vintage Al Horford game, and an ending for the ages.

Sometimes, it is best to just sit back and enjoy a basketball game instead of finding a narrative or overanalyzing everything. In a vacuum, this was one of those games. In reality, we still have a long way to go in this series and this game can tell us a lot about what we will see moving forward. So let's take a look at one of the biggest stories coming out of this game. Kevin Durant’s off night.

Despite excellent work on Durant, this was far from an excellent defensive game for the Celtics by their standards. They missed rotations, had miscommunications, and gave up easy open transition shots, all of which are extremely uncharacteristic for the Celtics most of the time.

Those issues matter, and if they persist going forwards in this series I may examine exactly what went wrong. But for now, the most surprising aspect of the Boston defense was not what went wrong. It was how well they stifled Kevin Durant, a man who is generally unshakeable and unguardable.

So how’d they do it? It started with one thing. Physicality. The playoffs have always been more physical than the regular season, especially when it comes to contact off the ball. We could see the refs start punishing that aggressiveness, but I don’t anticipate things changing dramatically.

One of the Nets’ favorite ways to get Kevin Durant is to give him a pindown screen and have him curl around it to catch it around the elbow. If you can't make that action difficult you don’t have a chance, once he gets the ball there and has a second to set his feet that midrange shot is essentially a layup. If you let him get there you need to get into his body before he gets into the air or pray he misses. Shockingly, that strategy doesn’t work often. The Celtics went the other way, committing to keeping the ball out of his hands during that action with switches and soft double teams.

When a team defends those pindowns like the Celtics did, you really have two options. You can go away from the play entirely and find either way to get KD the ball. You can attempt to exploit the defense’s choice by finding the big man setting the screen as he rolls to the rim. It’s a difficult pass, but it’s possible, and it can force the defense to adjust. The final possibility is having KD reset all the way to the perimeter and attack whichever big man switched onto him with some isolation offense. That’s what Brooklyn did time and time again in game one, and it almost never worked.

The Celtics switched more than any other team in the league, and it was a big part of why they ended the season as the best defense in the league. They can afford to switch for a few reasons. First off, everyone on the court can guard multiple positions. Marcus Smart can guard big men and Al Horford can guard some of the quickest players in the league when need be. Secondly, The Celtics communicate very well. Much of that credit should fall to Marcus Smart, a man who’s perimeter defense and communication skills earned him the Defensive Player of the Year Award. Finally, and arguably most important, the Celtics have help defense behind the primary defender. It doesn’t matter who that perimeter defender is. Jayson Tatum has quick hands, a good ability to read passes, and the athleticism to block shots when he needs it. Al Horford is a surprisingly quick big man and statistically one of the best isolation defenders off switches in the league

Once Kevin Durant had the ball in the perimeter, the Celtics forced him into the lane, where multiple defenders were always prepared to swipe at the ball and contest shots. This play is a perfect example. Grant Williams plays good, physical defense, forcing Durant into the busy lane. Once he gets there, Marcus Smart is ready to pounce on the ball and get the steal. Even if Durant had kept the ball from Smart, Horford was in great position to contest any type of shot at the rim. The Celtics have a lot of good individual defenders, but that’s not enough for Durant. You need to play as a team.

https://reddit.com/link/u80jdp/video/pxl6jj35opu81/player

The other problem for Durant was that the Celtics consistently knew where he wanted to go. Durant has a few spots he loves to get to, but when everyone knows where those spots are, good defenders can take advantage. Durant loves to take pull-up mid rangers from the right elbow, so the Celtics ran him off of that shot like he was Steph Curry at the three point line. On this play, (after some physical off-ball defense by Williams and Horford, Durant goes to that same shot, only to find that Williams was ready to swipe down and take the ball away as soon as Durant elevated for his shot.

https://reddit.com/link/u80jdp/video/3ibrrgt5opu81/player

Later in the game, the Nets forced a switch and then put the defender on an island by spreading out the floor and making it harder for the Celtics to help. The problem with that plan was that Al Horford put in an incredible performance defensively. He was repeatedly tasked with guarding KD, and not only did he take on the challenge, he welcomed it. Other Celtics helped when possible, but those opportunities were few and far between. Horford was a perfect blend of physical and disciplined, using his length to contest every shot Durant got off. On this play, Horford shifts his feet perfectly to stay in front of Durant, uses his body to stifle a blowby attempt, and then contests a midranger perfectly.

https://reddit.com/link/u80jdp/video/8cu69za8opu81/player

The switching defense was huge, but it only matters when Durant needs to force a switch in the first place. Only a few players can be effective as the primary defender for a full game, and even fewer can do that while shouldering a massive load offensively. Jayson Tatum is one of those few players. He played excellent defense on Durant, contested everything without fouling, and even blocked jumpshots by both Durant and Irving. There were a lot of examples of Tatum playing great defense on Durant, but none were quite as important as the final offensive possession for Brooklyn. Not only does Tatum move his feet well to keep KD in front of him, but he withstands a clear push off from the right hand of Durant before making up the lost space and making a picture perfect contest on the deep three-point shot. It doesn’t get much better than that.

https://reddit.com/link/u80jdp/video/jbxggrd9opu81/player

Kevin Durant will not shoot 37.5% from the field every game. That much is clear. But the Celtics defense has been elite for a long time, and there has been nothing to suggest that will change now. Whether or not Durant steps it up moving forward, he will have to work harder than ever to find opportunities to score. The Celtics have elite defenders all across the court, rotate intelligently and quickly, and have the ability to change defensive style on the fly whenever it is necessary. Game two is happening tonight, and Kevin Durant’s ability to find open space and get in rhythm could be the difference. The Celtics will make it tough, but if anyone can do it, it’s Kevin Durant.

GoNets,Nets Seeding Scenarios,"Hey guys, I'm a C's fan but since our teams might face off in the playoffs (which I definitely don't want), then I calculated the scenarios in which the Nets finish in the 7/8/9/10 seeds:

""To bring up the Nets possibility; essentially here's how the Nets can finish, because regular-season wise 7 is pretty much dead for them. The Hornets do have the tiebreaker on them, but the Hawks don't and in the event of a 3-way tie, the Nets finish at 8 due to conference record:

**7 seed**: CLE goes 0-3  
*If BKN goes 4-0*, then ATL/CHA go 3-1 or worse  
**8 seed**: CLE goes 1-2 or better  
*If BKN goes 1-3*, then ATL goes 0-4 AND CHA goes 1-3 (if ATL goes 0-4) or 0-4  
*If BKN goes 2-2*, then ATL goes 1-3 or 0-4 AND CHA goes 2-2 (if ATL goes 1-3) or worse  
*If BKN goes 3-1*, then ATL goes 2-2 or worse AND CHA goes 3-1 (if ATL goes 2-2) or worse  
*If BKN goes 4-0*, then ATL goes 3-1 or worse AND CHA goes 4-0 (if ATL goes 3-1) or worse  
**9 seed**: CLE goes 1-2 or better  
*If BKN goes 1-3*, ATL goes 1-3 or better AND CHA goes 0-4 OR ATL goes 0-4 and CHA goes 1-3 or better  
*If BKN goes 2-2*, ATL goes 2-2 or better AND CHA goes 1-3 or 0-4 OR ATL goes 1-3 or 0-4 and CHA goes 2-2 (if ATL goes 0-4) or better

GoNets,31 Days Until Brooklyn Basketball. #31 Jarrett Allen.,"Let's showcase one of our most promising rookies from last season, Jarrett Allen!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Wiki: Jarrett Allen (born April 21, 1998) is an American professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets for the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Texas Longhorns.

&amp;#x200B;

Allen attended St. Stephen's Episcopal School in Austin, Texas where he went on to win two SPC championships. He played in the 2016 McDonald's All-American Boys Game. He committed to the University of Texas at Austin to play college basketball.

&amp;#x200B;

As a freshman at Texas, Allen averaged 13.4 points and 8.4 rebounds per game. However, Texas finished a disappointing 11-22. His best game was a 22-point, 19-rebound performance in a 12-point loss to Kansas. After the season, he entered the 2017 NBA draft but did not initially hire an agent before deciding to forgo his remaining three years of collegiate eligibility.

&amp;#x200B;

Allen was selected with the 22nd overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft by the Brooklyn Nets. On July 20 he signed his rookie scale deal with the Nets. Allen was 19 years 182 days when he made his NBA debut on October 20, thus becoming the second-youngest player to ever step foot on court for the Nets, just behind Derrick Favors. He finished the game with nine points on 3-for-3 shooting, two rebounds, and one block. On January 25, 2018, Allen joined the starting lineup for the first time and recorded a career high 16 points and 12 rebounds in a 116-108 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. On February 2, 2018, in a game against the Los Angeles Lakers, Allen scored a career-high 20 points, as well as five rebounds and one block. On March 21, 2018, Allen recorded four blocks, which matched his career high, as well as six rebounds, and 9 points in a 111-105 loss to the Charlotte Hornets.

GoNets,You're not Shaq.,"So I was at the Charlotte game last night. Because tickets were cheap I happened to be sitting lower bowl. At the beginning of the game, while it was still basically tied, I turned to my GF and said, ""This is going to be a blow out, Howard is barely trying on defense, just watch.""

Well the Nets started building a big lead and Hornet's defense looked terrible. On offense Howard was looking for post ups and getting called for three second violations. Hornets looked like a mess. It looked like an easy win. 

Well then this guy on the other side of the arena started yelling out at Howard ""You're not Shaq."" It was loud. I could hear it easily on the other side of the arena. The crowd was laughing. The guy wouldn't stop. Other hecklers got into it as well. Again and again they were calling out Howard. 

Well I turned to my GF and said, ""If this guy doesn't stop, Howard is going to get pissed off."" Well, then Howard started dominating and you all know the rest. I'm really pretty sure that heckler lost us the game.

GoNets,Top 5 Nets Memories,"This sub has been toxic lately, the vibes are bad and we’re like passengers stranded on an island after a plane crash. Work’s been slow, kid’s in daycare, so I wanted to do a positive Nets related exercise for myself as they’ve been a big part of my life and now sharing it with you.

Hope we all can take a step back and realize, this is only a moment in Nets history and no matter how grim it looks now, it will get better, unless they move us away from the area. **Also fuck the Knicks.**


Would love to hear about what your favorite memories are of your time as a Nets fan. Here are mine in order from when it happened:

1. **Any alley-oop from Jason Kidd to Kenyon Martin.** There is no other play I would use to exemplify what the early 2000s Nets were. In an era of isolation and slow play, they were a fast break energy team, led by the dynamic duo of Kidd and Kenyon. Their signature off the backboard alley oop would send the crowd into the frenzy and send a spark into the rest of the team. Felt like one of the 3rd quarter Warrior runs where everyone suddenly became in-sync. Kidd was the conductor of the whole team, but Kenyon was the heart and soul.

Here’s some alley oops: https://youtu.be/D3xoDBiEHeY?si=sbAteppLm1uG-_nG



2. **Game 5 of the first round of the 2002 NBA Playoffs against the Pacers.** It’s win or go home, the Nets are up 3 with 5 seconds left, Nets rookie Richard Jefferson steps to the line. He has a chance to send the #1 seeded Nets to the second round, something that hasn’t happened since the 1983-1984 season. He chokes and misses both, the ball gets into his Reggie’s hands and he banks it in after the buzzer from near half court. The refs count it, there’s no in-game replays, the game is going into overtime. The kid in front of me is having a full on meltdown calling for Richard Jefferson to be banned from the state of New Jersey. That might have been the loudest the Continental Airlines Arena ever got. Thankfully, the Nets went on to win in double overtime and make it all the way to the NBA finals.

The play: https://youtu.be/WBhC1gMTsc8?si=e6bqAJz0HYZI3dRS



3. **The last game the Nets played in New Jersey.** The days of Jason Kidd were long gone. You think vibes now are bad? The team not only sucked, but for 2 years we knew this team was being taken away from us. The attendance was consistently bottom 3 in the league and the ticket prices were cheaper than a burger off the McDonald’s dollar menu. The Nets had moved from the Izod Center to Prudential in Newark, a stadium built for a hockey team. I can remember the atmosphere that night, it was the epitome of Chris Christie’s remarks to them leaving “good riddance”.

I certainly have more fond memories of the Nets, but this was the last Nets game I went to with my dad. He’s still alive so its not a sad story, but he refuses to make the trek out to Brooklyn. I was fortunate enough to be able to go to countless games with him growing up. It’s the reason I love the sport of basketball, the reason I love the Nets and always will.

TV Segment of the Final Game: https://youtu.be/_uRe08Gp6NQ?si=uCXFGfoJJZdp1yu6


4. **Kyrie's first game as a Net.** However you feel about the man and how he destroyed this franchise's championship dream, he was in the words of Stephen A Smith, box office. It was a pleasure watching his game on a night to night basis and there was no better night for me than his first game. There was debate amongst Nets fans if we should replace DLo with Kyrie and in one night it became apparent we made the right decision.

Kyrie goes off for 50 points, the Barclays was rocking as he’s making ridiculous 3s, crossovers, and layups. We entered a new era of Nets basketball, and it was going to be a great (as far as we knew). Wanted so badly for that game winner to go in, even so, it was a magical night of Nets basketball. It was one of those games I’ll never forget where I was watching it.

Here's the game: https://youtu.be/B1r6tgpxEwk?si=c37nDydk9RrrJIIj



5. **I got to see the Big 3 in person only one time.** Game 2 of the first round of the 2021 NBA Playoffs against the Celtics. The ball was popping, everyone was in sync, I was witnessing one of the greatest NBA teams in history playing at peak performance. The irony is, the best player in that game was Smoking Joe Harris. He single handily started the blowout with 16 in the first half. Finished with 25 pts and 7 3 pointers. Kinda wish they didn’t blow them out so I could’ve seen more of the Big 3, I remember telling my wife at least we can see them next season…

It made it special that Joe was the one leading this Big 3. He was the only guy left from the rebuild after we lost Dinwiddie (to injury), Levert, Jarrett, and DLo. Felt like a proud father watching his son not only play with the big boys but be the stand out.

GoNets,Sean Marks is about to pull off the ultimate heist,"One of my favorite Sean Marks moves that he's ever done is when he signed Tyler Zeller to a minimum contract, then put him in Atkinson's system which made him look good enough to be traded for Rashad Vaughn and a 2018 2nd rounder.  The Nets then traded that 2nd rounder and their own 2021 2nd rounder to dump Mozgov's contract at the expense of Dwight Howard's $18,919,725 in dead cap.  Vaughn was also traded for Cunningham, a vet who fit the team and system very well in his one year on the roster.

Marks has been collecting assets and taking on salary dumps for some time now, and he is about to pull off the ultimate heist.  In 2017, Marks traded Trevor Booker for Jahlil Okafor, Nik Stauskas, and NYK unprotected 2019 2nd rounder.  Okafor and Stauskas are both off the roster now.  Then in 2018, Marks took part in a 3-team trade in which the Nets traded away Jeremy Lin, Isaiah Whitehead, the rights to swap 2023 2nd rounders with Atlanta, and their 2025 2nd rounder for DEN 2019 1st rounder, Kenneth Faried, Darrell Arthur, DEN 2020 2nd rounder, and the rights to Isaia Cordinier.  He then traded Darrell Arthur for Jared Dudley and 2021 PHX 2nd rounder.

Why is this all relevant?  After the demands and frustration that Jimmy Butler has put on the Timberwolves, they are not going to get a good return for him.  I think it's 100% possible for the Nets to acquire Butler WHILE STILL KEEPING D'Lo, Crabbe, LeVert, Hollis-Jefferson, Allen, etc.  The Timberwolves will see that they are talking with two teams in the Knicks and Clippers who have little draft capital to offer (Knicks traded their 2019-2021 2nd rounders away but acquired new 2019-2021 2nd rounders, Clippers actually traded away their 2019 1st rounder).  The Nets will then swoop in with this offer: Kenneth Faried, Jared Dudley, DEN 2019 1st, NYK 2019 2nd for Jimmy Butler.  Minnesota will hate the offer initially, but eventually realize that that is the best offer they are going to get for the rebuild they are expecting.  Sean Marks is really about to turn Trevor Booker, Jeremy Lin, Isaiah Whitehead, pick swap of 2023 2nd rounder, 2025 2nd rounder into Jimmy Butler, DEN 2020 2nd rounder, PHX 2021 2nd rounder, and the rights to Isaia Cordinier.",40,16,2018-09-20,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/9hhp0y/sean_marks_is_about_to_pull_off_the_ultimate_heist/
GoNets,43 Days Until Brooklyn Basketball. #43 Kris Humphries.,"A 6 year journeyman turned his career around once he suited up for the Nets in '09-'10 and started to gain minutes with his scoring, rebounding, and overall hustle.

He scored in double figures in all 29 games, with 16 point/rebound double-doubles on the season for Minnesota. He averaged 21.7 points and 10.1 rebounds (both tops in the Big Ten), while shooting .444 percent from the field and .742 from the line. On February 18, 2004 he set a school record with 36 points in a game against Indiana. He also set a school record for most points by a freshman for a season with 629 and was the first Big Ten freshman to be named conference Player of the Week in two of the first three weeks of the season. Humphries only played one season for Minnesota before declaring for the NBA Draft.

&amp;#x200B;

Although Humphries was personally successful at Minnesota, the team struggled. The Gophers finished 12–18, with a 3–13 record in the Big Ten during Humphries' lone season, tying Penn State for the worst record in the conference. Critics accused Humphries of playing selfishly, preferring to inflate his statistics and NBA draft stock rather than help the team win games. The team had a .500 record before his arrival and finished with a 10–6 conference record in the season after he left.

&amp;#x200B;

Humphries was drafted by the Utah Jazz with the 14th overall selection in the 2004 NBA draft. He spent two seasons with the Jazz, averaging 3.6 ppg and 2.7 rpg in 11.6 minutes per game.

&amp;#x200B;

On June 8, 2006, Humphries was traded along with Robert Whaley to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Rafael Araújo. In the 2006–07 season, after a slow start in which he did not receive many minutes from Raptors coach Sam Mitchell, Humphries proved to be a valuable rebounder and energy player and contributed to the Raptors capturing their first ever division title. On March 28, 2007, he grabbed seven offensive rebounds in 27 minutes against the Miami Heat, both a game-high and a career-high. He followed up this performance with nine offensive and 18 total rebounds in a win against the Detroit Pistons on April 13, 2007, again both game and career-highs. Humphries concluded his inaugural season with the Raptors with a career-high 3.1 rpg and .470 field goal percentage, as well as 3.8 ppg.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 9, 2009, Humphries, Shawn Marion and Nathan Jawai were traded to the Dallas Mavericks as a part of the four-team deal among Raptors, Mavericks, Orlando Magic and Memphis Grizzlies.

&amp;#x200B;

On January 11, 2010 the Mavericks traded Humphries along with G/F Shawne Williams to the New Jersey Nets in order to re-acquire Eduardo Nájera. On January 27, 2010, Humphries scored a career-high 25 points against the Los Angeles Clippers. He previously recorded career highs of 15 and 21 points respectively as a New Jersey Net. The 2011 season was a breakout season for Humphries as he averaged a double-double in points and rebounds. On December 21, 2011, Humphries signed a one-year, $8 million contract with the New Jersey Nets.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 17, 2012, Humphries signed a two-year, $24 million contract with the Nets, who by that point had moved to Brooklyn.

&amp;#x200B;

On June 27, 2013, [ESPN.com](https://ESPN.com) reported that the Nets and Boston Celtics had worked out a trade that would send Humphries and four other players (Keith Bogans, MarShon Brooks, Kris Joseph and Gerald Wallace) as well as three future first-round draft picks to Boston in exchange for Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Jason Terry as well as D. J. White. The deal was finally completed on July 12, 2013.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 19, 2014, Humphries was acquired by the Washington Wizards in a sign-and-trade deal that sent a protected 2015 second round pick and a trade exception to the Boston Celtics. On October 9, 2014, he underwent successful surgery to repair nerve damage in his right small finger, and was subsequently sidelined for three to four weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

On November 14, 2015, Humphries made 5-of-8 three-pointers on his way to a game-high 23 points, helping the Wizards defeat the Orlando Magic 108–99. Prior to the 2015–16 season, Humphries had gone more than a decade since making a three-pointer. He hit two in his 2004–05 rookie season, and none after that, until this game.

&amp;#x200B;

On February 18, 2016, Humphries was traded, along with DeJuan Blair and a 2016 protected first round draft pick, to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Markieff Morris. He made his debut for the Suns the following day in a 116–100 loss to the Houston Rockets, recording 18 points and 12 rebounds in 27 minutes off the bench, becoming the 13th Suns player to have a double-double in his debut. On February 28, after three starts in four games, he was waived by the Suns in a buyout agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

On March 1, 2016, Humphries signed with the Atlanta Hawks. Three days later, he made his debut for the Hawks in a 106–77 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, recording 14 points, eight rebounds, one steal and one block in 22 minutes off the bench.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 15, 2016, Humphries re-signed with the Hawks.

&amp;#x200B;

On September 25, 2017, Humphries signed with the Philadelphia 76ers but was waived on October 14, 2017, as one of the final roster cuts.

&amp;#x200B;

Humphries began dating reality TV personality Kim Kardashian in October 2010. They became engaged in May 2011, and married on August 20, 2011. A two-part TV special showing the preparations and the wedding itself aired on E! in early October 2011, amidst what The Washington Post called a ""media blitz"" related to the wedding. On October 31, 2011, it was announced that Kardashian had filed for divorce from Humphries after 72 days of marriage. On December 1, 2011, Humphries filed his response to Kardashian's petition, requesting an annulment on the grounds of fraud or a decree of legal separation rather than Kardashian requested divorce. Several news outlets have surmised that Kardashian's marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt for financial gain orchestrated by E! Entertainment, Kris and Kim Kardashian to promote the Kardashian family's brand and their subsequent television ventures. In April 2013, after a lengthy legal battle, Humphries and Kardashian reached a divorce settlement. Their divorce was finalized on June 3, 2013.

&amp;#x200B;

Humphries was on the 2002 U.S. Junior World Championship Qualifying Tournament Team, alongside future Raptors' teammate Chris Bosh. The team finished with a 4–1 record and the bronze medal and qualified for a berth in the 2003 FIBA Junior World Championship. Humphries averaged 9.0 ppg and 5.0 rpg in five games.

Meanwhile a bunch of toothless people in some state called Oklahoma (only saw the musical and pretty sure the only valid form of transportation in the state is covered wagons) are cheering on their new team. 

This was the last NBA game I watched in its entirety.  However I have always enjoyed watching KD from time to time, as he will always hold a dear spot to us Seattle fans. 

This brings me to you all Net fans. I have since been upping my watch time of NBA and obviously first team I watch 15-20 games of is the Nets...well because of KD (even though he is broken 90% of the time)..I have come to the conclusion I will cheer for them regardless of KD or not (once again KD is injury prone)...So I ask you, will you accept this west coastian (with a KD Nets Jersey) into the Net family or am I banished until we (Seattle) get another team?",38,30,2022-03-22,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/tjqi11/do_yall_accept_new_fans_here/

GoNets,Seerat Sohi of The Ringer grades every NBA team and is harsh with her her Brooklyn Nets analysis,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Brooklyn Nets: F  
&gt;  
&gt;**Season record: 21-35**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Barclays Center has the energy of a dilapidated WeWork building: empty, aside from spare parts that remind you of the Nets’ once promising auspices and cataclysmic failure, the muted color palette and plain hardwood suggesting a preference for versatility and functionality over a set-in-stone identity. That’s exactly who the Brooklyn Nets, worse in record than talent, are: a team that can’t decide what it wants to be and isn’t doing much of anything as a result.  
&gt;  
&gt;The front office’s decision to fire Jacque Vaughn, who hasn’t commanded much respect—or much of an offense—doesn’t come as a surprise. Vaughn’s sign-off in his farewell to the Nets included the phrase amor fati, meaning “to love one’s fate,” which is a nice sentiment reflecting both his positive spirit and his rudderless approach to X’s and O’s. He always felt like a high-end developmental coach miscast as a head honcho.  
&gt;  
&gt;The guy the Nets want to build their franchise around, Mikal Bridges, expressed frustration with Vaughn all season, from his tepid [response](https://www.si.com/nba/nets/news/mikal-bridges-unhappy-with-brooklyn-nets-rest-choices-against-milwaukee-bucks) to Vaughn’s rest strategies to his advocacy for Cam Thomas to start. Using Bridges, a well-liked and ideal complementary star, as a sweetener to attract bigger fish to Brooklyn works only if he’s buying what he’s selling. I doubt they’d have the juice to entice an unhappy Luka Doncic or even Donovan Mitchell, considering the Knicks’ rise and Cleveland’s recent success. For the sheer theater, it would be incredible if Trae Young played across the bridge from Madison Square Garden. Maybe Brooklynites would start going to games again, just for the treat of booing him? But the Nets have work to do to become an attractive destination again. The Dennis Smith Jr. reclamation project has been the most inspiring thing about the team this season. Maybe interim coach Kevin Ollie—or Mike Budenholzer, whom they could target this summer—can reinvigorate the culture.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can’t help but wonder whether they would have been better off trading Bridges to the Rockets in exchange for the picks they relinquished in the James Harden deal and trading everyone else after that. Now, the Nets are positioned to overpay Nic Claxton to retain him. On the other hand, their stubborn insistence on keeping Kevin Durant as long as they did last season is why they were able to get Bridges, Johnson, and a hoard of picks for him.

GoNets,[Nets Daily] Joe and Clara Wu Tsai’s second attempt at a super team is working out just fine. (Go Liberty),,35,10,2023-10-01,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/16xfyhk/nets_daily_joe_and_clara_wu_tsais_second_attempt/
GoNets,Michael Scotto and Bobby Marks talk about The Trade deadline.,"**Scotto:** The Nets have been a little too quiet. They’re a team that I would say knows what they are right now. They are open for business and certainly taking calls. They’ve got a glut of wings, **Dorian Finney-Smith**, **Royce O’Neale**. It’s interesting because I feel like if they keep O’Neale, you almost wonder if they’re going to try to make a run at **Donovan Mitchell** because they’re very close friends. Finney-smith is a great player on an affordable contract. He’s a guy who could fit literally on every team, but on a championship contender or high-caliber playoff team, he’d be great. They would want the equivalent of two first-round picks for him, I’m told.

You touched on Dinwiddie. Before the season, Dinwiddie became eligible to do an extension. From what I’m told, they had brief exploratory short-term talks, whether it would’ve been a one-year or a two-year extension. Dinwiddie wanted a longer deal.

You mentioned that it seems like it’s the end of the road for Dinwiddie here for him in round two with the Nets. I would tend to agree. When he attacks downhill, he makes them a better team. He certainly wants to be a part of a team’s core (long-term). We did [**a podcast earlier in the year,**](https://hoopshype.com/lists/nets-spencer-dinwiddie-ben-simmons-cam-thomas-cam-johnson-kevin-durant-james-harden-free-agency/) and he made it clear that if he left, he’d leave the team in better hands, and he’d still be a Nets fan. It sounded like a guy who knew that, eventually, he’d probably be gone. When he talks about the core, he mentions everybody else and not himself.

As for **Ben Simmons**, you can’t count on him at all. I know all summer he was hyped up like **Don King** that he’s going to come back. Physically, he hasn’t been able to do it. When you talk of him as a former three-time All-Star, the keyword is “former.” You can’t view him like that right now because he can’t get on the court.

**Marks:** If Simmons was a free agent this offseason, he’d get the minimum because he’s not reliable. That’s just the reality of it. What team out there, unless you’re going to sign him and put an injury protection clause in there that protects every part of his body, what team would go out there? I thought he was pretty good in the games he played this year, but since 2020-21, he hasn’t played.

**Scotto:** He’s rebounded and passed the ball well. He’s been an above-average defender, not the All-Defensive Team player on defense. I saw the games. He didn’t drive to the rim in the half court. He doesn’t want to go to the foul line. You can’t have that at 6-foot-10. I don’t know if it’s a confidence thing or what it is, but when that’s not happening, that’s a problem.

The Nets also have to pay **Nic Claxton**. They’re making it seem like they’re preparing to pay him. Claxton told me [**he wants to re-sign in Brooklyn**](https://hoopshype.com/lists/nic-claxton-hopes-to-re-sign-with-brooklyn-i-love-it-here/) when we did our interview. I have him somewhere in the $20-25 million range.

**Marks:** He’s probably at what Poeltl got somewhere around four years, $80 million with Toronto. I like Claxton better than Poeltl. They’re just in a weird spot because Houston controls their draft picks for the next four years. Normally, you’d want to have your own pick, tear it down, build around Bridges, and go from there, but there’s no incentive to do that. On the other end, you do have all these expiring contracts and we talked about Dinwiddie, so who’s your point guard next year?

**Scotto:** I’ve got one more for you, Bobby, because he’s a hot topic, **Cam Thomas**. He’s one of the most polarizing players in the league. Before he got moved to the bench, he was the leading scorer for the Nets. He’s improved. He’s gotten to the rim more and drawn fouls. His shot selection improved, even though I won’t say it’s always the best. What are your thoughts on him and potential plans for him with the Nets?

**Marks:** I think he’s gotten better and gets to the free throw line a lot more than he did a year ago, and I think that’s a sign of a guy who’s not just relying on jumpers. You hear he’s an empty stats guy that can put up 29 points and you’ll lose consistently. Thomas for me is a sixth man right now, and could be a high-level sixth man. **Jordan Clarkson** was a sixth man for a long time and is really good. I think it’s going to be interesting. He’s extension-eligible this offseason because he’ll be going into year four. What do you do with him? I understand the fan base in Brooklyn because the fan base has prioritized him and he’s like one of their own children. When you get drafted by that organization and you develop with moments of really good play, it’s like he’s one of theirs and so is Claxton. Is Thomas fine with being a sixth man?

**Scotto:** Other guys around the league will tell me on a championship-caliber team, which is what every team aspires to be one day, Thomas could be a **Lou Williams** or **Jamal Crawford** type of guy.",35,69,2024-01-12,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1950apb/michael_scotto_and_bobby_marks_talk_about_the/
GoNets,Our Team Defense in 2020-21,"In ESPN's most recent win-loss forecast, Kevin Pelton predicted 38 wins for Brooklyn.  The most shocking forecast was the 26th place ranking in defensive rating.

The general hot take consensus on r/nba seems to be that Brooklyn will have a very good offense but a very bad defense, so this isn't coming out of left field.

I have a very different view.  I think Brooklyn will almost definitely have a Top 10 defense.  Here's why:

1) Let's start with the fact that **our defense was upper division last year, ranking 9th in defensive rating.**  The issue with our team was actually offense, with an offensive rating that ranked 22nd.  We are not building on a weak base.

2) **This was a team that was missing its three top players accounting for the majority of salary cap** for either the entire season (KD) or big chunks of the season (Irving and LeVert).  75% of this year's salary cap was out or hobbled for big chunks of last season, for a team that finished 9th in defensive rating.

3) **We are bringing back most of the core.** True, we are missing that guy who was probably the best defender on last year's squad in David Nwaba, but he only played 268 minutes so overall impact was minimal.  The most impactful loss might be Garrett Temple, who is a solid defender, but not elite.

4) **We are adding Durant.**  This will be the big variable.  If mostly healthy, he is a mobile near 7-footer that is very effective as a secondary paint defender alongside a primary big.  I was really happy with his mobility in the first pre-season game, he was blocking, disrupting passing lanes, taking charges, and using his length to impact shots in both the paint and mid-range.  Durant's defensive value is significant and is being woefully under-estimated by pundits.

5) **The impact of Kyrie Irving** \- the other oft-cited factor is the full-year impact of Irving, a ""terrible"" defender according to many.  First, I think a lot of this is just coming from people who just like to shit on Irving.   Second, while he's not a great defender, but he's not a terrible defender either.  He is quick, has very active hands and a ton of basketball IQ.  He isn't huge but at a solid 6'2"" he is not under-sized either.  He can contribute defensively if he's a) motivated and b) has energy/capacity.  

On the motivation factor, while Kyrie may not have been motivated in Boston, I am less concerned about that because he is clearly motivated to a) cement his legacy by adding another championship to his resume and b) doing it for his childhood team in the Nets.  It sucked for Boston fans that he may have not been motivated to go all out for that city, but I'm just not worried about that for Brooklyn.

6) **Defense is labor-intensive.**  NBA basketball players only have so much energy.  And often, guys who take on a heavy offensive load - like Irving in the past - are primarily focused on conserving their energy for the offensive.  This means giving less on the defensive end.

Because Brooklyn has so many weapons now, this takes the impetus off Irving to be the sole breadwinner.  This will allow him to expend more energy on the defensive end.  By the way, this concept applies to all the Brooklyn Nets, going down the line.  Caris Levert, in particular, is not going to be depended on for significant offense, so he can focus all of his energy on the defensive end.  He certainly has the tools to be a strong wing defender.  Same with Dinwiddie.

7) **We have strong defense where it matters.**  Defensive impact in the NBA tends to be highest the bigger you are.  Ideally, you want your strongest defenders (relative to their position) to be bigs and it is easier to hide mediocre defenders in your guards.

Brooklyn is better positioned in that its best defenders (again, relative to position) tend to be at the spots in the lineup were defense matters more.  Jarrett Allen is a very good defender, and he also plays at the position where it matters the most.  At age 22, and given his track record you can see him taking another step forward and becoming a truly elite defender.  He has become a very good rebounder, he can guard the pick and roll, his feet are quick enough where he can do a passable job defending perimeter players and most significantly he is one of the strongest paint defenders in the league.

DeAndre Jordan isn't the defender he used to be, but he is still a strong paint defender.

As mentioned earlier, the addition of Durant means that for 30 minutes of most games, we will have two near-7-footers patrolling the paint area.  I think our paint defense will be very strong this year.

On the flip side, our worst defenders (on a relative basis) tend to be at the positions where defense matters less.  This would be at the 1 and the 2 positions, with guys like Irving, Dinwiddie, Harris and Shamet.

8) **Versatility is key.**  We just have a lot more piece to work with this year.  This is again the effect of adding two superstars at the top of the pyramid, pushing everybody down and improving the team at every level from starters to role players.  We have so much more depth this year because we aren't carrying 75% of dead salary cap on our roster.

Adding a defensive specialist like Bruce Brown is key to this.  He is a strong on-ball guard and wing defender that can be deployed situationally.  Green is also another athletic wing that provides versatility to be able to be deployed from the 3 to the 5 depending on matchups and situationas.

Steve Nash seems much more willing than Kenny Atkinson to be creative and dynamic with lineups.  Part of this may be just having more tools to work with, but I think part of it is philosophical as well.

**Bottom line:** I think Brooklyn is going to over-perform on pre-season expectations.  While it may take a little time to gel, barring major injuries, I think by the time the playoffs comes along, we will have a #5-#7 ranked team defense.  Along with a #1-2 ranked offense, this will put is in a good position for a very deep playoffs run.

What do you think about Brooklyn's defense this coming year?",34,23,2020-12-17,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/kevv47/our_team_defense_in_202021/
GoNets,3 Days Until Brooklyn Basketball. #3 Drazen Petrovic.,"Came into his own in his second season with the Nets but was sadly taken too soon.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Wiki: Dražen Petrovic (pronounced \[dra?en petro?it?\]; October 22, 1964 – June 7, 1993) was a Croatian professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he initially achieved success playing professional basketball in Europe in the 1980s, before joining the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1989.

&amp;#x200B;

A star on multiple stages, Petrovic earned two silver medals and one bronze in Olympic basketball, a gold and a bronze in the FIBA World Cup, a gold and a bronze in the FIBA EuroBasket, and two EuroLeague titles. He represented Yugoslavia's national team and, later, Croatia's national team. He earned four Euroscars, and was named Mr. Europa twice. In 1985, he received the Golden Badge award for best athlete of Yugoslavia.\[1\]

&amp;#x200B;

Seeking a bigger arena after his career start in Europe, Petrovic joined the NBA in 1989, as a member of the Portland Trail Blazers. After playing mostly off the bench that year, Petrovic experienced a breakthrough following a trade to the New Jersey Nets. While starting for the Nets, he became one of the league's best shooting guards. Petrovic's career and life were cut short after he died in a car accident at the age of 28.\[2\]

&amp;#x200B;

Petrovic is considered the crucial part of the vanguard to the present-day mass influx of European players into the NBA.\[3\] Petrovic's #3 was retired by the Nets in 1993, and in 2002, he was posthumously enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\[4\] In 2013, he was voted the best European Basketball player in history, by players at the 2013 FIBA EuroBasket.

&amp;#x200B;

Born in Šibenik, SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia, Dražen Petrovic was the second child of Jovan ""Jole"", a police officer, and Biserka (née Mikulandra), a librarian.\[3\] His father, of Serb ethnicity, was born in Zagora, near Trebinje in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\[6\]\[7\]\[8\] His mother was born in Bilice, near Šibenik, and was from a traditional conservative Croat family, devoutly Roman Catholic.\[9\] The couple's eldest child, Aleksandar, would be the first one to tread the basketball path, providing a lead for his younger sibling. The Petrovic siblings are second cousins to the Serbian basketball player Dejan Bodiroga.

&amp;#x200B;

At the age of thirteen, Petrovic started playing in the youth selections of the local club Šibenka; at the age of fifteen he had already made the first team, just as Šibenka earned a place in the Yugoslav national first division. With young Petrovic as the star of the team, Šibenka reached the final of the FIBA Radivoj Korac Cup twice (1981–82 and 1982–83), losing to Limoges CSP both times. In 1983, the 18 year-old Petrovic hit two free throws for Šibenka's victory over Bosna in the final playoff game of the Yugoslavian club championship, but the title was taken away from Šibenka the next day by the national basketball federation with irregularities in refereeing cited as the reason, and awarded to Bosna after Šibenka refused to show up for the repeat match.

&amp;#x200B;

After spending a year serving the mandatory time in the military, Petrovic followed his brother's footsteps and moved to Cibona to form, at that time, the best backcourt duo in Europe. The very first year in Cibona he won both the Yugoslav League championship and the Yugoslav National Cup. To top it all off, the 87–78 victory over the Spanish League club Real Madrid, to which Petrovic contributed with 36 points, brought him and Cibona their first European Cup title. The second came the following year, as Petrovic scored 22 points and Cibona defeated the USSR Premier League club Žalgiris Kaunas, which starred the legendary Arvydas Sabonis. The same year brought another Yugoslav national cup title for Cibona, seeing Petrovic score 46 against the old rival Bosna. In 1987, Petrovic earned his third European trophy: a 2nd-tier European Cup Winners' Cup title against the Italian League club Scavolini Pesaro, whose net he filled with 28 points.\[14\]

&amp;#x200B;

Petrovic's scoring average during the four years with Cibona stood at 37.7 points in the Yugoslavian first division and 33.8 in all of the European wide competitions that he played in, with personal one-time bests of 112 (40/60 FG, 10/20 3Pts, 22/22 FT) in the Yugoslavian League, and 62 points in the 3rd-tier European league, the Korac Cup, respectively.\[15\] His scoring sheet was often known to show 40, 50, even 60 in a single game; in a 1985–86 season European League game against Limoges, Petrovic scored ten 3-pointers, including seven in a row during a first half stretch, for a final tally of 51 points and 10 assists;\[16\] the same season he scored 45 points and dished out 25 assists against the reigning Italian League champions Simac Milano.\[17\]\[18\]

&amp;#x200B;

Petrovic needed new challenges, which Cibona and the Yugoslavian League could not offer. Across the Atlantic, the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA had already used their third round pick on young Petrovic in 1986. However, he decided to postpone his departure to the United States. In 1988, he signed with Real Madrid instead, for at that time a hefty sum of around US$4 million.\[19\] The transfer wasn't without controversy as the Yugoslav sporting laws stipulated that players weren't allowed to professionally move abroad until reaching 28 years of age, while Petrovic was still only 23 when he signed with the famous Madrid club. In 2014, José Antonio Arízaga, the sports agent who played a key role in Petrovic's summer 1988 transfer from Cibona to Real, recalled a few details from this transaction: ""I spoke to Mirko Novosel, Dražen's coach at Cibona, and he told me two things. One, every problem in Yugoslavia can be taken care of with the right amount of money, and two, if Dražen leaves, every other player under 28 will be leaving and it'll be chaos. So, you can imagine all the individuals I had to bribe and all the places where I had to pay up in order to circumvent this law"".

&amp;#x200B;

The 1988–89 season saw Petrovic wear the colors of the Spanish ACB League basketball club Real Madrid. Although the Spanish national championship barely escaped them, as they lost to FC Barcelona in the fifth and decisive game of the league's final series, Petrovic helped Real to win the Spanish King's Cup title over their Catalan rivals. Petrovic also led the club to victory in the 2nd-tier European Cup Winners' Cup final against the Italian League club Snaidero Caserta by tying his previous best scoring performance in European competitions (62 points).\[19\] His first season in the ACB was also his last, but he still holds ACB single performance bests in a final series game in points made (42) and three-pointers made (8).\[15\]

&amp;#x200B;

Motivated by the challenge and pressured by the Portland Trail Blazers, who had drafted him 60th overall back in 1986, Petrovic finally stood firm in the decision to try to establish himself in the NBA. He left Spain rather abruptly at the end of the season; the Blazers assisted in buying out his contract with Real (for as much as US$1.5 million)\[21\] and Petrovic joined the Blazers for the 1989–1990 season.

&amp;#x200B;

The Blazers valued Petrovic as a shooter, but were concerned that he might not possess the quickness to play guard or the foot speed to play defense. They brought him onto the team primarily as an outside threat to shoot three-pointers. In the Blazers' offensive scheme he was to set up behind the line, receive a passed ball and go directly up to release his shot. Petrovic was an aggressive, attacking player who was used to creating his shot and shots for his teammates. Taking the ball out of his hands and making him a static shooter was foreign to him. Making matters worse, the Blazers already had a full rotation of guards, with a starting backcourt of Clyde Drexler and Terry Porter, and with veteran Danny Young as a reserve. Consequently, the reigning La Gazzetta dello Sport Euroscar European Player of the Year saw limited playing time. He had difficulty being productive in the limited role the Blazers had for him. In his rookie year during the 1989–90 NBA season, he averaged 7.4 points in 12 minutes playing time per game.\[22\] The following season veteran guard Danny Ainge was added to the team, and Petrovic's playing time dropped further to 7 minutes a game.\[22\] In many statements made prior to arriving in Portland, Petrovic had said he saw a lack of playing time as the only possible obstacle to his success in the NBA.\[19\]\[23\] He was determined to be a success in basketball's highest arena. His lack of playing time during his second season in the league brought Petrovic's frustration to a climax: ""I have nothing to say to Adelman any more and vice versa. Eighteen months have passed by, too long. I have to leave to prove how much I am worth. Never in my life did I sit on the bench and I don’t intent to do that in Portland.""\[24\]

&amp;#x200B;

At his insistence, 38 games into the season (20 of which held no playing time for Petrovic), a three-way trade with the Denver Nuggets sent him to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for a first-round pick in the following draft and Walter Davis, who was sent from Denver to Portland.

&amp;#x200B;

On January 23, 1991, Petrovic became a member of the New Jersey Nets. He joined a team that had not reached the playoffs since 1986, but had rookie Derrick Coleman, the number one selection from the 1990 draft. He was immediately given a role on the floor, with 20.5 minutes per game. His scoring over the remaining 43 games increased to 12.6 points per game, one of the league's best points-per-minute ratios. The following year, he and Coleman were joined by Kenny Anderson, giving the team a third talented new addition. Petrovic was made a starter for the 1991–92 season, his first full season with the Nets. Petro, as the Americans had dubbed him, did not miss a single game. His determination, hard work and aggressive on court demeanor established him as a team leader. In 36.9 minutes on the floor he averaged 20.6 points. Petrovic led the Nets in field-goal shooting and free-throw shooting, and his field goal percentage of 51% placed him near the top of all NBA guards. More importantly, his success translated into success for the team. The Nets made the playoffs, recording 14 more wins than the previous year. The following season saw Petrovic increase his scoring average to 22.3 ppg, 11th best in the league. On December 6, he was named MVP of the Week.\[27\] For the second season in a row he shot 45% from the three-point arc. His field goal percentage of 52% was again near the top for all guards. American media honored him with a selection to the All-NBA Third Team. However, he did not receive an invitation to the 1993 All-Star game. Among the top 13 scorers in the NBA that season, he was the only one not invited.\[28\]\[29\]

&amp;#x200B;

In an interview on the Scoop B Radio Podcast, Petrovic's Nets teammate, Chucky Brown marveled at Petrovic's healing ability. Brown told Brandon Scoop B Robinson that he remembered Petrovic spraining his knee and was slated to miss two months. Petrovic rehabbed so hard that he ended up only missing two weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Petrovic's national team debut came at the age of 15, at the Under-18 Balkan Championship in Turkey, where the Yugoslavian junior team won the bronze. The young man regularly played for the Yugoslavian national team in the Balkan Championships, also winning gold with the junior team and silver with the senior team. He also brought back the silver from the 1982 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship in Bulgaria.

&amp;#x200B;

The 1984 Summer Olympics were Petrovic's first competition of a grand scale with the Yugoslav senior national team, and the bronze medal won in Los Angeles that summer became his first Olympic medal. Third place was also earned at the 1986 FIBA World Championship, remembered for the last minute thriller in the semi-final game against the Soviet Union. At the 1987 EuroBasket, Petrovic again returned with bronze, as Yugoslavia lost to the hosts and gold medalists Greece. The University Games, held in Zagreb in 1987, saw the Yugoslavian squad with Petrovic win the gold. In the 1988 Summer Olympics, Yugoslavia with Petrovic, earned 2nd place, as they lost once more to the Soviet powerhouse.\[14\]

&amp;#x200B;

An excellent club season with Real Madrid was topped by Petrovic's 1989 accomplishment with the Yugoslav national team: at the EuroBasket in Zagreb, the young Yugoslavian team went all the way, defeating Greece more than comfortably in the championship game. Petrovic was the tournament's second leading scorer and most valuable player. The very next year, the summer in between the two most frustrating seasons of his professional career, as he struggled for playing time with the Trail Blazers, Petrovic was again making history with the national team, as Yugoslavia became world champions, after beating the Soviet Union for the gold in Buenos Aires, at the 1990 FIBA World Championship.

&amp;#x200B;

The 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, marked the first summer Olympics featuring the independent Croatia, and Petrovic was the leader of the Croatian national basketball team at the Olympic basketball tournament. Losing only to the American Dream Team in group stage, a strong and inspired Croatian team emerged victorious from the Semifinals against the revamped Soviet team, thanks to clutch free throws executed by Petrovic, and faced off against the Americans for the gold. Urged on by Petrovic's competitiveness and confidence,\[3\] the Croatians fared well in the first ten minutes of the game, taking a 25–23 lead on a Franjo Arapovic dunk and the subsequent free throw.\[32\] As the game progressed, however, the now-legendary team composed of NBA stars proved too tough for Croatia: the Americans won 117–85, sending Petrovic, the game's leading scorer with 24 points, and his teammates, home with silver medals.\[3\]\[33\]

&amp;#x200B;

In the period during which Petrovic played for the Croatian national team (from 1992 to 1993), he appeared in 40 games and scored 1,002 points. His highest point tally came against Estonia, on 31 May 1993 (48 points).

&amp;#x200B;

In the summer of 1993, after his best NBA season and the Nets' first-round elimination by the Cleveland Cavaliers, Petrovic traveled to Berlin, where the Croatian national team was playing a qualification tournament for the 1993 EuroBasket. He was contemplating departure from the Nets, disappointed with tension between himself, and in his belief, envious teammates, as well as the fact that the Nets had not yet extended his contract. He told American reporters that the lack of recognition in the league had him also considering leaving the NBA completely and playing club basketball in Greece; there were at least two Greek clubs ready to offer Petrovic three-year contracts worth US$7.5 million net.\[26\] It was rumored that Petrovic verbally agreed on terms with Panathinaikos; these rumors gave rise to the story of PAO's owner, Pavlos Giannakopoulos, allegedly offering the Nets' star a signed contract with blank salary terms, which became a part of Petrovic's legend. Petrovic decided to skip the connection flight back to Zagreb and drive with his girlfriend back to Croatia.

&amp;#x200B;

Petrovic died in a traffic accident at approximately 17:20 on Monday, June 7, 1993, four and a half months before his 29th birthday. On the rain-drenched Autobahn 9, he was a passenger in a car that was cut off by a semi truck at Denkendorf, near Ingolstadt, in the German state of Bavaria. According to the report of the Ingolstadt police, that afternoon a truck broke through the Autobahn median; the truck driver was trying to avoid a collision with a personal vehicle in his own lane and lost control of the truck, crashing through the median barrier and finally coming to a stop blocking all three lanes of traffic in the opposite direction (Munich). Seconds later, the VW Golf carrying a sleeping Petrovic in the passenger seat crashed into the truck, killing him and leaving the driver, Klara Szalantzy, a Hungarian model and basketball player with whom Petrovic was romantically involved, and Hilal Edebal, a female Turkish basketball player, with grave injuries.\[26\]\[35\] It was established that visibility on the road was very poor and that Petrovic was not buckled with a seatbelt.\[3\]

&amp;#x200B;

Petrovic's tomb 45°50'22?N 15°59'00?E at Mirogoj Cemetery instantly became a sanctuary for his compatriots. The Cibona stadium was renamed the Dražen Petrovic Basketball Hall on October 4, 1993, and the city of Zagreb dedicated a square in his name, which was later followed by Šibenik and Vukovar, while Petrinja dedicated him a street. The Nets retired his number 3 jersey on November 11, 1993. After 1994, the MVP award at the McDonald's Championship had borne the name Dražen Petrovic Trophy, and the Croatian Olympic Committee's award for young athletes has borne his name since 2006. On April 29, 1995, a statue commemorating Petrovic's significance to the world of sports was erected in front of the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, thus making him only the second athlete to receive this honor. On July 9, 2001, having defeated Patrick Rafter to win the men's singles title at Wimbledon, Croatian tennis player Goran Ivaniševic dedicated the win to his late friend Petrovic;\[36\] Ivaniševic wore Petrovic's Nets jersey amidst the 100,000 strong crowd celebrating his victory in Split.\[3\] Petrovic was inducted posthumously into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2006, the 13th anniversary of Petrovic's death was marked with the opening of the Dražen Petrovic Memorial Center in Zagreb, dedicated to his life and achievements, with ten themed galleries of multimedia content outlining his entire career and a four meter high statue of Dražen in shooting position in front of it. Petrovic was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2007.\[37\]

&amp;#x200B;

The 2010 documentary, Once Brothers (part of the ESPN 30 for 30 series), portrays the achievements of the Yugoslavia national basketball team in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and how the Yugoslav Wars tore the team apart. It explores Petrovic's broken friendship with Serbian/Yugoslav player Vlade Divac. In 2011, a statue of him as a little boy sitting on a bench with a ball was unveiled in Šibenik, and his old room was renovated the way it looked when he was young, as a first part of opening a Memorial Center in his hometown. During the 2012 Three Point Shootout, New Jersey Nets guard Anthony Morrow wore Petrovic's jersey in the latter's honor. In 2015, Australian writer Todd Spehr released a 470-page biography on Petrovic, Dražen: The Remarkable Life &amp; Legacy of the Mozart of Basketball.\[citation needed\] On June 3, 2015. Croatian basketball journalists Marjan Crnogaj and Vlado Radicevic released a 487-page (462 footnote) unofficial biography \[38\] which global paperback edition (472 pages, 679 footnotes, 50 photos) was released on October 14, 2017.\[39\]

&amp;#x200B;

A museum named ""The Dražen Petrovic Memorial Center"" was founded in his honor, and constitutes a co-operative effort led by the Dražen Petrovic Foundation in conjunction with the Croatian government, the city of Zagreb and the Croatian Museum of Sports. The memorial center idea originated from Petrovic's parents, Biserka and Jole Petrovic, and was supported with the contributions of Croatian architects Andrija Rusan and Niksa Bilic. All of the articles presented in the center have been collected and categorized by the Croatian Museum of Sports. The organization and operations of the center have been provided by the Dražen Petrovic Foundation, which is led by Petrovic's family. The Center contains his No. 3 New Jersey Nets jersey and the watch that stopped when he died in a car crash. The center features 1,000 memorabilia items and a video of his basketball highlights.\[43\]

&amp;#x200B;

The official opening of the museum was held on June 7, 2006, while the official opening of the center to the public began at the end of December 2006. The square on which the center is operated upon has been renamed to Dražen Petrovic Square in his honor.\[44\] In 2013, former NBA MVP Derrick Rose visited the museum.

GoNets,For Those Looking for Nets Podcasts,"Spent way too much time listening to Nets podcasts the past few years so wanted to give some recs for any fans looking for Nets pods to listen to.

* **The Backcourt:** New podcast hosted by Lucas Kaplan and Sarah Kustok. Extremely excited for this podcast. Lucas does a great job with Nets content and is very knowledgeable with the X's and O's. Sarah, we all know is amazing and the plan for this pod seems to be going deeper into the X's and O's and discussing more niche topics about the team.
* **Brooklyn Buzz:** Jac and Nick do a great job with game recaps, covering recent news/quotes, interesting stats and storylines around the team. Good listen after feeling hyped from a win or feeling empty from a loss. Leans a bit more on the homer side, but they are in tune with everything surrounding the team and I feel are a good representation of the fan base. Upbeat, more positive podcast with good energy.
* **Bleav in Nets:** Hosted by Erik Slater, one of the Nets beat reporters. Been impressed with this podcast so far, I think Erik does a great job and has great info on the team. Frequently has guests on the pod (Ian Eagle episode was great), so good for having a more detailed look at news/perspectives on the team.
* **Voice of the Nets with Chris Carrino:** Chris is the play-by-play announcer for Nets radio. He does a lot of interviews with players on the team and did a series of recaps with Lucas Kaplan and Tim Capstraw (Color commentator for Nets radio) for a lot of players on the team.
* **The Brooklyn:** Another relatively new podcast hosted by Anthony Puccio and Collin Helwig of Nets Daily. If you've followed the Nets for a while, you'll be familiar with Pooch. Have only listened to a couple episodes but seems promising knowing Pooch and his connection to the Nets.

Other Nets podcasts if you're interested:

* **Locked On Nets:** These guys can't be beat when it comes to the consistency and quantity of episodes they produce. I think they are in tune and knowledgeable about the team and do a good job covering recent topics/news. In my opinion, have very rational, unbiased opinions regarding the team and the players.
* **The Glue Guys:** Disappeared sometime last year but was one of the main Nets podcasts for a while. Wasn't my favorite as I felt they weren't as in tune with the team as you might think. I don't know if they will be making a comeback.

  
Shoutout to The Clear Out podcast by Matt Brooks. Miss when he was covering the Nets during the KD, Kyrie era. There are definitely more good Nets pods out there that I haven't taken the time to listen to, so I'm interested to know any new recs as well.",33,9,2024-11-02,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1gi840j/for_those_looking_for_nets_podcasts/

GoNets,[Analysis] Rodion Kurucs reaches a low point and DeAndre Jordan exerting more effort on defense,"**Kurucs hits a low point**

[In prior analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/dne0go/analysis_the_reason_to_why_caris_levert_was/), I’ve mentioned Kurucs propensity to pump fake on threes, drive, and end up turning the ball over or missing a shot. Yesterday verse the Pelicans, he did it multiple times, leading to turnovers and a missed shot. Because of this, it got to the point where he was unplayable and Atkinson benched him for the entire second half. He’s struggling badly and while a lot of it is self-inflicted with the non-shooting, a very small portion of it isn’t. 

Last season, three aspects made up majority of Kurucs offense: [Spot-up shooting](https://i.imgur.com/g5zh9uN.png), [Cutting](https://i.imgur.com/L9Me3W7.png), and [Transition](https://i.imgur.com/Ww6x58s.png). But I want to look mostly at the cutting aspect of the offense, because it is non-existent this season. Regarding his offense coming from cuts, I think he misses D’angelo Russell, who he received the most passes and scored the most off the passes. When you watch Kurucs' highlights last season, he had good synergy with Russell for off-ball cuts.

For example:  
[D'angelo drives to the rim and hits Kurucs on a back cut for a dunk](https://streamable.com/2q9n4)

[D'Lo drives to the rim after a JA screen and hits Kurucs back door](https://streamable.com/9g4k1)

[Seems to be a pistol action, but Kurucs cuts back door instead of going towards D'Lo and gets a dunk](https://streamable.com/2ra5q)

[Kurucs fakes out Blake Griffin and gets an alley oop pass off a cut](https://streamable.com/d950v)

[Another D'Lo / JA high P&amp;R that leads to a back cut score by Kurucs](https://streamable.com/6xhzi)

[Here's a twitter thread involving more examples, most of them including Kurucs.](https://twitter.com/HalfCourtHoops/status/1153794109838020608)

This season, this hasn’t been happening for Kurucs. It took the DET game on Saturday for him to finally (I believe) register a basket off a cut and it was from Dinwiddie in the second quarter. To me, this a lack of chemistry with all the guards. Kyrie is new, Caris had a pass frequency to Kurucs of only 3.1% last season, and Dinwiddie isn’t exactly pass first (though he had the second highest pass frequency to Kurucs in 2018). 

Regardless if these back door cuts are available to him or not, he needs to take these wide open threes. However, since he's not, he's going to be dead weight on offense. He's actively taking out the main component of his offensive production and it's hurting him and the team.

**DeAndre Jordan being more active on defense** 

[I've also mentioned previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/dof7we/analysis_contextualizing_the_nets_passing/) that DJ should be more active on defense by putting a hand up if he isn't going to jump to contest shots. In the last two games, while he hasn't been perfect, he's has been giving more effort defensively.

[DJ gets the block from behind on Jrue Holiday when the Pelicans were pushing in transition](https://streamable.com/6zld4)

[Pistons run HORNs with Bruce Brown as the ball handler. He goes to the rim, DJ goes vertical, and forces the miss. ](https://streamable.com/e3pb2)

Some of these might be the result of playing against teams with centers that don't space the court and/or playing teams with poor spacing (DET), but wasn't exerting the effort he has recently. Not to imply he's perfect, he still has instances were he's not putting up his hand on shot attempts or not jumping, but it feels like it's reduced the last two games. It's a good sign going forward, but it sucks he got hurt. 

**Other opinions**

Me, like a lot of Nets fans, were excited about this season with the new additions to the roster. With the new additions, there was an idea coming into the season that the Nets bench this season would be better than last years. In theory, it makes sense. 

* DeAndre Jordan can fill Ed Davis’s role easily as a P&amp;R center and excellent rebounder.
* David Nwaba is Treveon Graham 2.0 (which is both good and problematic).
* Dinwiddie was a 6MOTY candidate last year, no reason he shouldn’t be this year.
* Garrett Temple can fill in DeMarre Carroll’s and Jared Dudley’s role as a veteran presence on and off the court. 
* Kurucs would make incremental improvement regardless if he started of was on the bench. 

Well, we've been wrong so far. this team's bench has been horrendous to start the season. The team went from a 10 man rotation on opening day to basically an 8 man rotation yesterday to finish the game. Dinwiddie is playing like he belongs in the g-league again (please play better soon), DJ just got hurt, Kurucs won't shoot jumpers, Temple is Temple, and Nwaba has been benched for three games now. The bench has been so bad that you can honestly make the case that the center coming off the bench has been their best bench player. If Dinwiddie starts playing like or close to his last season version, this problem might go away for the regular season, but there are still issues that will exist going forward, especially offensively. 

With DeAndre Jordan most likely out for an extended period with the ankle sprain (granted, no word yet), we might be able to see Claxton play on the road trip. He'll give the Nets a different dynamic with him at center if he's forced to switch out onto guards, but I still wouldn't expect much. He's still incredibly skinny compared to the rest of the NBA, so he'll get bounced around in the paint with ease. And he hasn't really played against NBA competition. That being said, having him play back up minutes against Portland isn't the worst thing if he has to play. The only real center they have right now is Whiteside and you can just match his minutes with JA. 

Prediction for the road trip: My gut feeling says 3-2, but it could also be 2-3. I think Portland is a good match up for the Nets. The Nets have played them well the last two seasons, but Dame and CJ can go off at any time, especially vs. the Nets horrible defense. And they'll be playing the Nets on a B2B. I wouldn't expect them to win @ UTA because they've generally sucked there the last few seasons. And I think they can pick up at least two games between the hot Phoenix Suns / Struggling Denver Nuggets / Struggling Chicago Bulls.",32,6,2019-11-05,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/ds6iii/analysis_rodion_kurucs_reaches_a_low_point_and/
GoNets,"Since the Pistons loss on Feb 10th, the Nets have the 6th best 2nd Half Defensive Rating in the league","I know that sounds like a cherrypicked stat, but a lot of us are aware that ever since that Pistons loss (I believe that's the one where Harden and DJ were arguing/discussing tactics after or at the end of the game), our defence has looked better. 

For the season, our DRtg is 113.3 (22nd in the league) and since that Pistons loss, our DRtg is 113.1 (21st in that span) so at face value it doesn't look there's much of a difference. For the season, our 1st Half DRtg is 112.1 (17th) and 2nd Half is 114.2 (27th). 

However, since that Pistons loss, our 1st Half DRtg is 116.3 (26th), but our 2nd Half DRtg is 110.1, which is the 6th best during that span. Our 4th quarter DRtg since the Pistons loss is 109.6, 11th best during that span. This is a sample of 43 games, so not that small. 

Before the Pistons loss, our 1st Half DRtg was 106.5 (6th, lol wtf), but our 2nd half was dead last at 120.8 (27 game sample).",31,9,2021-05-15,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/nctlwv/since_the_pistons_loss_on_feb_10th_the_nets_have/

GoNets,All I ask is to SHOW UP and play hard,"Literally this is all I ask for any player on the Nets. Just show up to play and play hard. If we are not talented enough or we miss shots I’m fine. I’m fine if a player makes mistakes on the court. No one is perfect.

But there are TWO THINGS every player in the NBA can control:

Show up

Play hard

If a player isn’t willing to do one of those things I’m done with him. He is dead to me. There is ZERO EXCUSE for not doing those things

For FOUR YEARS Kyrie hasn’t showed up to play. Constantly. Every year. 

When he missed games because of the Capitol Riots I made my position clear: TRADE HIS ASS. I don’t care how talented you are. If you don’t give the team a high priority, I don’t want you here. People here said I was crazy for wanting to get rid of him then. And every year since then Kyrie has proven me right.

I will be SO HAPPY to see Kyrie finally gone from this team. Crazy Cancer Kyrie. I can finally cheer for a team that I know has 13 guys who are bought in. 13 guys who will SHOW UP and PLAY HARD. 

I can deal with losing games. I can deal with losing in the playoffs. I cannot deal with a player who doesn’t have the decency to show up. 

Kyrie talks about being a leader. Bullshit. Leaders show up. During good times and especially bad times.

Kyrie calls his teammates his brothers. Bullshit. A brother doesn’t abandon you when they need you the most.

Kyrie says he loves the fans. Bullshit. You love money. You love pushing your own agenda. You love holding yourself out as some type of deep thinker. The truth is you are just a selfish prick.

GoNets,We should have some Liberty nights at Nets game next year. ,"The Kal trade, it was the right move but damn, I can't help but think about the here and now and how much next season is gonna suck at Barclays.  It's like getting an infected tooth pulled.  It's gonna suck but yeah, gotta suck it up and do it.  And I still have trouble getting over it's to the Knicks.  

I'm a Liberty STH, and I get the W is not for everyone but they do a great job of creating a fun atmosphere.  Why not bring the best mascot in the biz, Ellie the Elephant, to some Nets games and create some fun moments instead of looking at Ben Simmons' outfits.  The Timeless Torches, everyone would love them.   Shit, the Liberty have more celebrities at their games then the Nets do now, so it couldn't hurt.

GoNets,6 Days Until Brooklyn Basketball. #6 Kenyon Martin.,"&amp;#x200B;

Less than a week away and we're going to go with one of the heart and soul pieces of the Kidd Era teams, K-Mart! If only we could've found a way to keep him and add VC then we would no doubt be coming out of the East on a yearly basis. K-Mart ended up getting paid and sign and traded to Denver but ultimately knee injuries kept him from being the player that he was in NJ. Still he was a fan favorite and great energy guy that synced perfectly with Kidd's style of play.

&amp;#x200B;

Wiki: Martin was born in Saginaw, Michigan on December 30, 1977 to Lydia Moore, a single mother of two. He has a sister, Tamara, who is 3 1/2 years older. Shortly after, the family moved south to the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas, where she worked two jobs. Later, Kenyon was often watched by his sister while their mother worked.

&amp;#x200B;

He stuttered as a child, and attended three high schools in four years, but he sought refuge in sports, playing basketball, baseball, and football. In high school, many major universities showed interest in his basketball prowess, but the University of Cincinnati and assistant coach John Loyer recruited him hardest after seeing him play AAU ball after his junior year. He graduated from Bryan Adams High School in Dallas in 1996 (he was named to the school's hall of fame in 2009).

&amp;#x200B;

He went to the University of Cincinnati and played for the Cincinnati Bearcats under the direction of head coach Bob Huggins. He was homesick early in his freshman year and actually took a bus back to Dallas. But his mother as well as his older sister, who by then were working two jobs and attending college, steered him to return to school.

&amp;#x200B;

By the time he was a junior, he led Cincinnati to a 27-6 record and was named second-team All-Conference USA and, in the summer following, he led the U.S. team to the gold medal in the World University Games, leading the team in scoring and rebounding.

&amp;#x200B;

As a senior in 1999–2000, he averaged 18.9 points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.5 blocks per game during a season in which the Bearcats were ranked #1 for 12 weeks. That season, he recorded his second triple double with 28 points, 13 rebounds, and 10 blocks vs. Memphis (in 1997, he recorded 24/23/10 vs. DePaul). Martin was the consensus National Player of the Year, earning numerous awards from various organizations, and the team was ranked #1 in the nation at the conclusion of the regular season. However, Martin suffered a broken leg three minutes into the Bearcats' first game of the Conference USA Tournament, keeping him out of the NCAA Tournament that year. The team finished with a record of 29-4.

&amp;#x200B;

He remains the Bearcats' all-time leader in career blocked shots (292) and field goal percentage (.586). Cincinnati retired his #4 jersey on April 25, 2000. Later that year, Martin was selected first overall in the 2000 NBA draft by the New Jersey Nets. Martin is currently the last American-born college senior to have been the top overall pick.

&amp;#x200B;

Martin graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice.

&amp;#x200B;

As a rookie for the New Jersey Nets, Martin averaged 12 points, 7.4 rebounds and 1.7 blocks per game. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team and finished second in voting for NBA Rookie of the Year. In his second season, Martin averaged 14.9 points, 5.3 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 1.7 blocks per game in helping the Nets rise from last place in the Atlantic Division to an Eastern Conference title and the best season to date in the Nets' NBA history. Along with Jason Kidd, Kerry Kittles, Keith Van Horn and Richard Jefferson, Martin led the Nets to the 2002 NBA Finals, where they were swept by the Los Angeles Lakers. In his third season Martin again helped his team into the NBA finals, where the Nets lost in six games to the San Antonio Spurs. The next year, Martin averaged 16.7 points, 9.5 rebounds and 1.3 blocks en route to his first NBA All-Star selection, as a backup forward for the Eastern Conference All-Stars. In the 2004 NBA All-Star Game, Martin scored 17 points, grabbed 7 rebounds and had 3 assists.

&amp;#x200B;

Martin and teammate Alonzo Mourning almost fought when Martin mocked Mourning's life-threatening kidney disease. Martin later admitted that he had made a mistake and apologized to Mourning. On an episode of the Scoop B Radio Podcast, Martin told Brandon Scoop B Robinson that Mourning thought that Martin should have been working as hard as he was in morning shootarounds, but he was never a shootaround guy. Martin now participates in Mourning's annual charity basketball game (see below ""Off the court"").

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the 2003–04 season, Martin was traded to the Denver Nuggets for three future first-round draft picks in a sign-and-trade deal.

&amp;#x200B;

Martin played in 70 games during the 2004–05 season, averaging 15.5 points and 7.3 rebounds; however, a problem with his knee was detected shortly into the off-season, and on May 16, 2005, Kenyon underwent microfracture surgery on his left knee.

&amp;#x200B;

During the 2005–06 season, Martin missed 26 games due to knee tendinitis, but was able to return in time for the playoffs. During that playoff series against the Los Angeles Clippers, Martin was suspended from the Denver Nuggets indefinitely for ""conduct detrimental to the team.""During halftime of game two of the first round series, Martin got into an argument with head coach George Karl over his playing time, and refused to play for the second half of the game. During the offseason, Karl and Martin apparently ""patched things up.""

&amp;#x200B;

Believing injuries were behind him, Martin learned the swelling now occurring in his right knee would require another microfracture procedure. On November 15, 2006, after playing two regular season games, Martin underwent his second knee operation in less than two years. Martin is believed to be the first NBA player to have, and to return from, microfracture surgery on both knees.

&amp;#x200B;

Martin was fined $15,000 by the NBA when, during the third quarter of a 2006 game against the Chicago Bulls, Martin as well as some of his friends got into a verbal altercation with some fans. He was also cautioned to no longer bring his entourage to games.

&amp;#x200B;

To symbolize a fresh start to his career, Kenyon changed his uniform number from 6 to the number 4, which he wore in college, for the 2007–08 season.

&amp;#x200B;

Martin became an unrestricted free agent in the summer of 2011; however, due to the 2011 NBA lockout, he opted to sign a one-year contract with the Xinjiang Flying Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association. His contract reportedly would have made him the highest paid player in the Chinese league's history. On December 24, 2011, Martin was released from the club so that he could ""take care of family affairs"". Martin was initially not allowed to return to the NBA until the Flying Tigers' season ended on February 15, 2012, if not later due to the 2012 CBA Playoffs. However, the FIBA granted him an earlier release on February 2.

&amp;#x200B;

On February 3, 2012, Martin signed with the Los Angeles Clippers. In his first game with the Clippers, Martin scored 6 points and collected four rebounds in a loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.

&amp;#x200B;

On February 21, 2013, Martin agreed to join the New York Knicks on a 10-day contract, which reunited him with Jason Kidd. He officially joined the team on February 23. He was signed to a second 10-day contract on March 5, and signed for the remainder of the season on March 15. Upon his signing, he provided a large amount of help to a Knicks team that was depleted in the frontcourt, replacing Tyson Chandler, who was out with a neck injury, in the Knicks' starting lineup. On July 25, 2013, Martin re-signed with the Knicks for the 2013–14 season.

&amp;#x200B;

On January 9, 2015, Martin signed a 10-day contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. He made his Bucks debut later that night, recording 6 points, 2 rebounds and 1 block in the 98-84 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. He went on to sign a second 10-day contract with the Bucks on January 19, and for the rest of the 2014–15 season on January 29.

&amp;#x200B;

On February 19, 2015, Martin was waived by the Bucks.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 3, 2015, Martin announced his retirement from professional basketball.

&amp;#x200B;

Martin is the half-brother of former Colorado Buffaloes shooting guard Richard Roby. He is also the cousin of Robert ""50"" Martin of AND1 Mixtape Tour fame. 

&amp;#x200B;

Martin started The Kenyon Martin Foundation to provide for families in need, especially those without a father figure in their lives. According to the foundation's website, organizations receiving grants (many in the Denver and Dallas areas) include All for One and One for All, American Institute for Stuttering, Bryan Adams High School (his alma mater), Colorado HAWKS (Hard At Work Kids) to ""create an opportunity and an alternative to gangs for at-risk, disadvantaged youth"", The Children's Museum of Denver, Denver Rescue Mission, Ludacris Foundation Helping Youth Help Themselves initiative, SafeHaven of Tarrant County domestic violence shelter for women, The Salvation Army, The Bridge Project, Third Way Center ""providing mental health treatment in a residential setting for troubled teens"", and Warren Village that helps ""low-income single-parent families achieve sustainable personal and economic self-sufficiency."" The foundation also runs the Hoops for Kids Basketball camp.

&amp;#x200B;

He has been active in support of non-profit The Stuttering Foundation of America since 2005, and in 2008 he was a recipient of the Freeing Voices, Changing Lives Leadership Award from the American Institute for Stuttering, for which he serves on the board of directors. He has served as honorary Ambassador for the March of Dimes Colorado Chapter to raise awareness about premature birth. He plays in the annual The Summer Groove in Miami, a charity event benefitting Alonzo Mourning Charities and Dwyane Wade's World Foundation. He also supports Special Olympics.

&amp;#x200B;

Martin has also been involved in philanthropic activities including donating $1,000 for each point and blocked shot in two games for the Asian tsunami relief efforts, buying the occasional home game ticket for less financially fortunate fans, and participating in number of campaigns like ""Eat Right"" and ""Art of Sport.""

GoNets,45 Days Until Brooklyn Basketball. #45 Gerald Wallace.,"He started off as a fun energetic player in New Jersey but soon turned into a massive liability for Brooklyn just a season later. However today we look back at the Nets career of ""Crash"".

&amp;#x200B;

Wiki: Gerald Jermaine Wallace (born July 23, 1982) is an American retired professional basketball player. He played college basketball with Alabama.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace attended Childersburg High School in Childersburg, Alabama, where he had a very successful career. For his senior season efforts, he was named the Naismith Prep Player of the Year, an honor given to the best high school basketball player.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace attended the University of Alabama for one season before declaring himself eligible for the 2001 NBA draft. Wallace was drafted in the first round as the 25th overall pick. In 2000–01, he averaged 9.8 points and 6.0 rebounds per game.

&amp;#x200B;

In three seasons with the Sacramento Kings, Wallace rarely played, but in his brief appearances, he made himself known for his versatility and extraordinary athleticism. In the 2002 Slam Dunk Contest, Wallace finished second to two-time winner Jason Richardson. During his tenure with the Kings, Wallace was the odd man out in a deep roster that included All-Stars Chris Webber, Peja Stojakovic, Vlade Divac, Hedo Türkoglu and Brad Miller.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace was selected by the Charlotte Bobcats as part of the 2004 NBA Expansion Draft. He would start immediately for the club, and went on to have a season of averaging 11.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 1.3 blocks a game. He continued to improve in 2005–06, before getting injured in January, averaging 14.5 points and 7 rebounds, and ranking in the top 10 in the NBA in field goal percentage (54.142), blocks (2.19), and steals per game (2.44). Since the NBA began counting blocks as a statistic in 1973, only two other players (David Robinson and Hakeem Olajuwon) in league history have averaged over 2.0 blocks and 2.0 steals per game in a single season.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace was known for his somewhat reckless style of play that led to his frequent injuries and earned him the nickname ""Crash"". He missed a total of 39 games in his first two years with the Bobcats, but his energetic and sometimes dangerous behavior that may have caused his injuries was also what contributed to his gaudy defensive stats. Coach Bernie Bickerstaff said of Wallace ""Gerald can only play one way and be effective. Energy -- that's his game."" In 2006, Wallace attempted to refine his game in order to avoid being injured, and as a result his numbers suffered. The first month of the season, Wallace had only five total blocks (an average of .3 per game) and his averages were down across the stat line from 2005. Wallace improved his play in the second month of the season, but he went down with a separated shoulder in a December game against the Indiana Pacers. When he returned, Wallace continued his fine play finishing the season averaging 18.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2 steals, and 1 block in 72 games.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace appeared opposite Tim Duncan in the March 2008 ""SLAM-UP"" centerfold for SLAM Magazine.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace continued his fine play finishing the season averaging 18.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2 steals, and 1 block in 72 games.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace appeared opposite Tim Duncan in the March 2008 ""SLAM-UP"" centerfold for SLAM Magazine.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace suffered a Grade 3 concussion on February 23, 2008 after taking an unintentional elbow to the face from Sacramento's Mikki Moore. It was his fourth concussion in as many seasons with the Bobcats. It was not clear when he would return, although Grade 3 concussions are defined by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons as ones that ""involve post-traumatic amnesia for more than 24 hours or unconsciousness for more than five minutes. Players who sustain this grade of brain injury should be sidelined for at least one month, after which they can return to play if they are asymptomatic for one week."" He returned later on in the season, finishing the year with a new career high in points, assists, and minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

He suffered a partially collapsed lung and a fractured rib after being flagrantly fouled while driving for a layup by Los Angeles Lakers' Andrew Bynum on January 27, 2009 and was forced to miss seven games. He also was unable to fly and instead crossed the United States en route back to Charlotte by bus.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace was selected to play in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game in Dallas, becoming the first and only Charlotte Bobcat to do so (with the Bobcats changing their name back to their original Hornets name after reclaiming the Charlotte NBA history originally owned by the Pelicans franchise in 2014). Wallace was also selected to participate in the 2010 NBA All-Star Weekend Slam Dunk Contest. He was also selected to the 2010–2012 USA Basketball Men's National Team to represent the United States in the 2010 FIBA World Championship along with a possible trip with the team to the 2012 Olympics.

&amp;#x200B;

In the first-ever playoff game for the Bobcats, Wallace led the team with 25 points. This franchise playoff single game scoring record lasted until game 2 of the series, when Stephen Jackson broke the record by scoring 27 points.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2010, Wallace was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team. During the 2010–2011 season as a Bobcat, he averaged 15.6 points per game, 8.2 rebounds per game, and 2.4 assists per game in 39 minutes per game. He played 48 games with the team during the season.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace is one of three players in NBA history (the others being David Robinson and Hakeem Olajuwon) to average at least two steals and two blocks per game over the course of an entire season.

&amp;#x200B;

On February 24, 2011, Wallace was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for Joel Przybilla, Dante Cunningham, Sean Marks, and two future draft picks. He provided help for the team while Brandon Roy was injured. The Trail Blazers finished 48-34, good for the playoffs. They lost in the opening round to the Dallas Mavericks in 6 games. In the next season as a Trail Blazer, Wallace averaged 13.3 points per game, 6.6 rebounds per game, and 2.7 assists per game in 35.8 minutes per game. He played 42 games with the team that season.

&amp;#x200B;

On March 15, 2012, Wallace was traded from the Portland Trail Blazers to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for Shawne Williams, Mehmet Okur and a 2012 top-3 protected 1st round draft pick. On April 8, 2012, Wallace injured his left leg on a put back dunk. Wallace would only play 2 more games the entire season. Wallace played in 16 total games for the Nets that season and averaged 15.2 points per game. On July 11, 2012, Wallace re-signed with the Nets. The contract is reportedly worth $40 million for four years. In the first game of the season Wallace injured his left ankle. With just 27 seconds left on the game clock, Wallace got hurt trying to block a shot by Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry. After the game the team announced it was a sprained left ankle. Wallace would miss 6 games before making his return. Wallace would get injured again when the Nets played the Phoenix Suns on January 11, 2013. Wallace injured his ribs after the Phoenix Suns player P. J. Tucker fouled him hard while attempting a fast break dunk early in the first quarter. Wallace landed awkwardly on the floor and remained on the court for several moments before being helped to get on his feet and to the locker room. He did not return to the game. Wallace would miss 2 games until he returned to play the Atlanta Hawks.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace was traded to the Boston Celtics on July 12, 2013, in a multi-player deal that sent Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Jason Terry to the Nets.

&amp;#x200B;

On February 28, 2014, Wallace was ruled out for the rest of the season after an MRI revealed a torn meniscus in his left knee.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 27, 2015, Wallace was traded, along with Chris Babb, to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for David Lee. Four days later, Wallace was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, along with cash and draft considerations, in exchange for Jason Thompson. On September 27, 2015, he was waived by the 76ers.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace is represented by agent Rob Pelinka.

&amp;#x200B;

Wallace started The Gerald Wallace Foundation to provide opportunities for underserved children and their families in his hometown of Childersburg, Alabama, and his former playing city of Portland, Oregon.

GoNets,"32 Days Until Brooklyn Basketball. #32 ""Dr. J"" Julius Erving.","No question who #32 would be!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Wiki: Julius Winfield Erving II (born February 22, 1950), commonly known by the nickname Dr. J, is an American retired basketball player who helped popularize a modern style of play that emphasizes leaping and playing above the rim. Erving helped legitimize the American Basketball Association (ABA) and was the best-known player in that league when it merged with the National Basketball Association (NBA) after the 1975–76 season. He is now a coach of Tri-State of the BIG3.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving won three championships, four Most Valuable Player Awards, and three scoring titles with the ABA's Virginia Squires and New York Nets (now the NBA's Brooklyn Nets) and the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers. He is the eighth-highest scorer in ABA/NBA history with 30,026 points (NBA and ABA combined). He was well known for slam dunking from the free throw line in slam dunk contests and was the only player voted Most Valuable Player in both the ABA and the NBA.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving was inducted in 1993 into the Basketball Hall of Fame and was also named to the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time team. In 1994, Erving was named by Sports Illustrated as one of the 40 most important athletes of all time. In 2004, he was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame.

&amp;#x200B;

Many consider him one of the most talented players in the history of the NBA; he is widely acknowledged as one of the game's best dunkers. While Connie Hawkins, ""Jumping"" Johnny Green, Elgin Baylor, Jim Pollard and Gus Johnson performed spectacular dunks before Erving's time, ""Dr. J"" brought the practice into the mainstream. His signature dunk was the ""slam"" dunk, since incorporated into the vernacular and basic skill set of the game in the same manner as the ""crossover"" dribble and the ""no look"" pass. Before Julius Erving, dunking was a practice most commonly used by the big men (usually standing close to the hoop) to show their brutal strength which was seen as style over substance, even unsportsmanlike, by many purists of the game. However, the way Erving utilized the dunk more as a high-percentage shot made at the end of maneuvers generally starting well away from the basket and not necessarily a ""show of force"" helped to make the shot an acceptable strategy, especially in trying to avoid a blocked shot. Although the slam dunk is still widely used as a show of power, a method of intimidation and a way to fire up a team (and spectators), Dr. J demonstrated that there can be great artistry and almost balletic style to slamming the ball into the hoop, particularly after a launch several feet from that target.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving was born in East Meadow, New York, and raised from the age of 13 in Roosevelt, New York. Prior to that, he lived in nearby Hempstead. He played for Roosevelt High School and received the nickname ""Doctor"" or ""Dr. J"" from a high school friend named Leon Saunders. He explains,

&amp;#x200B;

I have a buddy—his name is Leon Saunders—and he lives in Atlanta, and I started calling him ""the professor"", and he started calling me ""the doctor"". So it was just between us...we were buddies, we had our nicknames and we would roll with the nicknames. Lo and behold we graduate from high school together, we both go to U-Mass, and we separated for many years 'cause he went over to Africa and did some stuff, and I went my way. But now he's my golf buddy in Atlanta...and I love him. He's just like a little brother to me even though, you know, there's only months between us. But he's the professor and he was the first one to call me ""the doctor"". And that's where it came from.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving recalled, ""Later on, in the Rucker Park league in Harlem, when people started calling me 'Black Moses' and 'Houdini', I told them if they wanted to call me anything, call me 'Doctor,'"" Over time, the nickname evolved into ""Dr. Julius,"" and finally ""Dr. J.""

&amp;#x200B;

Erving enrolled at the University of Massachusetts in 1968. In two varsity college basketball seasons, he averaged 26.3 points and 20.2 rebounds per game, becoming one of only six players to average more than 20 points and 20 rebounds per game in NCAA Men's Basketball.

&amp;#x200B;

Having left college early to pursue a professional career, Erving earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst through the University Without Walls program in creative leadership and administration in 1986, fulfilling a promise he had made to his mother. Erving also holds an honorary doctorate from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

&amp;#x200B;

Although NBA rules at the time did not allow teams to draft players who were less than four years removed from high school, the ABA instituted a “hardship” rule that would allow players to leave college early. Erving took advantage of the rule change and left Massachusetts after his junior year to sign a four-year contract worth $500,000 spread over seven years with the Virginia Squires.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving quickly established himself as a force and gained a reputation for hard and ruthless dunking. He scored 27.3 points per game as a rookie, was selected to the All-ABA Second Team, made the ABA All-Rookie Team, led the ABA in offensive rebounds, and finished second to Artis Gilmore for the ABA Rookie of the Year Award. He led the Squires into the Eastern Division Finals, where they lost to the Rick Barry-led New York Nets in seven games. The Nets would eventually go to the finals, losing to the star-studded Indiana Pacers team.

&amp;#x200B;

Under NBA rules, he became eligible for the 1972 NBA draft and the Milwaukee Bucks picked him in the first round (12th overall). This move would have brought him together with Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. However prior to the draft, he signed a contract with the Atlanta Hawks worth more than $1 million with a $250,000 bonus. The signing with the Hawks came after a dispute with the Squires where he demanded a renegotiation of the terms. He discovered that his agent at the time, Steve Arnold, was employed by the Squires and convinced him to sign a below-market contract.

&amp;#x200B;

This created a dispute between three teams in two leagues. The Bucks asserted their rights to Erving via the draft, while the Squires went to court to force him to honor his contract. He joined Pete Maravich at the Hawks' training camp, as they prepared for the upcoming season. He played two exhibition games with the Hawks until J. Walter Kennedy ruled that the Bucks owned Erving’s rights via the draft. Kennedy fined the Hawks $25,000 per game in violation of his ruling. Atlanta appealed Kennedy’s decision to the league owners, who also supported the Bucks’ position. While waiting for the owners’ decision, Erving played in one more preseason game, earning the Hawks another fine. Erving enjoyed his brief time with Atlanta, and he would later duplicate with George Gervin his after-practice playing with Maravich.

&amp;#x200B;

On October 2, Judge Edward Neaher issued an injunction that prohibited him from playing for any team other than the Squires. The judge then sent the case to arbitrator because of an arbitration clause in his contract with Virginia. He agreed to report to the Squires while his appeal of the injunction made its way through the court.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in the ABA, his game flourished, and he achieved a career-best 31.9 points per game in the 1972–1973 season. The following year, the cash-strapped Squires sold his contract to the New York Nets.

&amp;#x200B;

The Squires, like most ABA teams, were on rather shaky financial ground. The cash-strapped team sent Erving to the Nets in a complex deal that kept him in the ABA. Erving signed an eight-year deal worth a reported $350,000 per year. The Squires received $750,000, George Carter, and the rights to Kermit Washington for Erving and Willie Sojourner. The Nets also sent $425,000 to the Hawks to reimburse the team for its legal fees, fines and the bonus paid to Erving. Finally, Atlanta would receive draft compensation should a merger of the league result in a common draft.

&amp;#x200B;

He went on to lead the Nets to their first ABA title in 1973–74, defeating the Utah Stars. Erving established himself as the most important player in the ABA. His spectacular play established the Nets as one of the better teams in the ABA, and brought fans and credibility to the league. The end of the 1975–76 ABA season finally brought the ABA–NBA merger. The Nets and Nuggets had applied for admission to the NBA before the season, in anticipation of the eventual merger that had first been proposed by the two leagues in 1970 but which was delayed for various reasons, including the Oscar Robertson suit. The Erving-led Nets defeated the Denver Nuggets in the swan-song finals of the ABA. In the postseason, Erving averaged 34.7 points and was named Most Valuable Player of the playoffs. That season, he finished in the top 10 in the ABA in points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, steals per game, blocks per game, free throw percentage, free throws made, free throws attempted, three-point field goal percentage and three-point field goals made.

&amp;#x200B;

The Nets, Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs joined the NBA for the 1976–77 season. With Erving and Nate Archibald (acquired in a trade with Kansas City), the Nets were poised to pick up right where they left off. However, the New York Knicks upset the Nets' plans when they demanded that the Nets pay them $4.8 million for ""invading"" the Knicks' NBA territory. Coming on the heels of the fees the Nets had to pay for joining the NBA, owner Roy Boe reneged on a promise to raise Erving's salary. Erving refused to play under these conditions and held out in training camp.

&amp;#x200B;

After several teams such as the Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers lobbied to obtain him, the Nets offered Erving's contract to the New York Knicks in return for waiving the indemnity, but the Knicks turned it down. This was considered one of the worst decisions in franchise history. The Sixers then decided to offer to buy Erving's contract for $3 million—roughly the same amount as the Nets' expansion fee—and Boe had little choice but to accept. This would total $6 million overall, with the other half going to Erving. His new jersey number 6 would derive from the $6 million paid by the Philadelphia 76ers; it also matched the team nickname ""Sixers"". For all intents and purposes, the Nets traded their franchise player for a berth in the NBA. The Erving deal left the Nets in ruin; they promptly crashed to a 22–60 record, the worst in the league.Years later, Boe regretted having to trade Erving, saying, ""The merger agreement killed the Nets as an NBA franchise . . . . The merger agreement got us into the NBA, but it forced me to destroy the team by selling Erving to pay the bill.""

&amp;#x200B;

Erving quickly became the leader of his new club and led them to an exciting 50-win season. However, playing with bigger stars forced his role to diminish. In the ABA, he would be told to do everything for his team. With the Sixers, he focused more on scoring. Despite a smaller role, Erving stayed unselfish. The Sixers, featuring other stars like ABA co-MVP George McGinnis, ABA All-Star Caldwell Jones, future All-Star World B Free (then Lloyd Free), outside shooting threat Henry Bibby (father of Mike Bibby), and the versatile and aggressive Doug Collins (later Michael Jordan's coach during the late 1980s), won the Atlantic Division and were the top drawing team in the NBA. The Sixers defeated the defending champions, the Boston Celtics, to win the Eastern Conference. Erving took them into the NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers of Bill Walton. After the Sixers took a 2–0 lead, however, the Blazers defeated them with four straight victories after the famous brawl between Maurice Lucas and Darryl Dawkins which ignited the Blazers' chemistry.

&amp;#x200B;

However, Dr. J enjoyed success off the court, becoming one of the first basketball players to endorse many products and to have a shoe marketed under his name. It was at this time that he appeared in television commercials urging young fans asking for his autograph in an airport to refer to him henceforth as ""Dr. Chapstick"". He also starred in the 1979 basketball comedy film, The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh. A famous TV commercial for Sixers season tickets during the 1977–78 off-season summed up Erving's desire to win an NBA Title. In the commercial, Erving was in the Sixers locker room and he said to fans, ""We owe you one"" while he held up his index finger. It took a few years for the Sixers franchise to build around Erving. Eventually coach Billy Cunningham and top-level players like Maurice Cheeks, Andrew Toney, and Bobby Jones were added to the mix and the franchise was very successful.

&amp;#x200B;

In the following years, Erving coped with a team that was not yet playing at his level. The Sixers were eliminated twice in the Eastern Conference Finals. In 1979, Larry Bird entered the league, reviving the Boston Celtics and the storied Celtics–76ers rivalry; these two teams faced each other in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1985. The Bird vs. Dr. J matchup became arguably the top personal rivalry in the sport (along with Bird vs. Magic Johnson), inspiring the early Electronic Arts video game One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1980, the 76ers prevailed over the Celtics to advance to the NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. There, Erving executed the legendary ""Baseline Move"", a behind-the-board reverse layup. However, the Lakers won 4–2 with superb play from, among others, Magic Johnson.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving again was among the league's best players in the 1980–1981 and 1981–1982 seasons, although more disappointment came as the Sixers stumbled twice in the playoffs: in 1981, the Celtics eliminated them in 7 games in the 1981 Eastern Finals after Philadelphia had a 3–1 series lead, but lost both Game 5 and Game 6 by 2 points and the deciding Game 7 by 1) and in 1982, the Sixers managed to beat the defending champion Celtics in 7 games in the 1982 Eastern Finals but lost the NBA Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers in 6 games. Despite these defeats, Erving was named the NBA MVP in 1981 and was again voted to the 1982 All-NBA First Team.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, for the 1982–83 season, the Sixers obtained the missing element to combat their weakness at their center position, Moses Malone. Armed with one of the most formidable and unstoppable center-forward combinations of all time, the Sixers dominated the whole season, prompting Malone to make the famous playoff prediction of ""fo-fo-fo (four-four-four)"" in anticipation of the 76ers sweeping the three rounds of the playoffs en route to an NBA title. In fact, the Sixers went four-five-four, losing one game to the Milwaukee Bucks in the conference finals, then sweeping the Lakers to win the NBA title.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving maintained his all-star caliber of play into his twilight years, averaging 22.4, 20.0, 18.1, and 16.8 points per game in his final seasons. In 1986, he announced that he would retire after the season, causing every game he played to be sold out with adoring fans. That final season saw opposing teams pay tribute to Erving in the last game Erving would play in their arenas, including in cities such as Boston and Los Angeles, his perennial rivals in the playoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving retired in 1987 at the age of 37. ""A young Julius Erving was like Thomas Edison, he was always inventing something new every night"", Johnny Kerr told ABA historian Terry Pluto. He is also one of the few players in modern basketball to have his number retired by two franchises: the Brooklyn Nets (formerly the New York Nets and New Jersey Nets) have retired his No. 32 jersey, and the Philadelphia 76ers his No. 6 jersey. He was an excellent all around player who was also an underrated defender. In his ABA days, he would guard the best forward, whether small forward or power forward, for over 40 minutes a game, and simultaneously be the best passer, ball handler, and clutch scorer every night. Many of Erving's acrobatic highlight feats and clutch moments were unknown because of the ABA's scant television coverage. He is considered by many as the greatest dunker of all time.

&amp;#x200B;

In his ABA and NBA careers combined, he scored more than 30,000 points. In 1993, Erving was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. When he retired, Erving ranked in the top 5 in scoring (third), field goals made (third), field goals attempted (fifth) and steals (first). On the combined NBA/ABA scoring list, Erving ranked third with 30,026 points. As of 2018, Erving ranks eighth on the list, behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, Dirk Nowitzki, and LeBron James.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving in this memorable contest would face George ""The Iceman"" Gervin, All-Star and former teammate Larry ""Special K"" Kenon, MVP Artis ""The A-Train"" Gilmore, and David ""The Skywalker"" Thompson. Erving would start by dunking two balls in the hoop. Then, he would release a move that brought the slam dunk contest to the national consciousness. He would go all the way to the end of the court and run to release a free throw line dunk. Although dunking from the foul line had been done by other players (Jim Pollard and Wilt Chamberlain in the 1950s, for example), Erving introduced the dunk jumping off the foul line to a wide audience, when he demonstrated the feat in the 1976 ABA All-Star Game Dunking Contest.

&amp;#x200B;

This event transpired during game 6 of the 1977 NBA Finals. After Portland scored a basket, Erving immediately ran the length of the court with the entire Blazers team defending him. He performed a crossover to blow by multiple defenders and seemingly glided to the hoop with ease. With UCLA defensive legend Bill Walton waiting in the post, Erving threw down a vicious slam dunk over Walton's outstretched arms. This dunk is considered by many to be one of the strongest dunks ever attempted considering he ran full court with all five defenders running with him. This move was one of the highlights of his arrival to a more television-exposed NBA.

&amp;#x200B;

One of his most memorable plays occurred during the 1980 NBA Finals, when he executed a seemingly impossible finger-roll behind the backboard. He drove past Lakers forward Mark Landsberger on the right baseline and went in for a layup. Then 7'2? center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar crossed his way, blocking the route to the basket and forcing him outwards. In mid-air, it was apparent that Erving would land behind the backboard. But somehow he managed to reach over and score on a right-handed layup despite the fact that his whole body, including his left shoulder, was already behind the hoop. This move, along with his free-throw line dunk, has become one of the signature events of his career. It was called by Sports Illustrated, ""The, No Way, even for Dr J, Flying Reverse Lay-up"". Dr J called it ""just another move"".

&amp;#x200B;

Another of Erving's most memorable plays came in the final moments of a regular-season game against the Los Angeles Lakers in 1983. After Sixers point guard Maurice Cheeks deflected a pass by Lakers forward James Worthy, Erving picked up the ball and charged down the court's left side, with one defender to beat—the Lakers' top defender Michael Cooper. As he came inside of the 3-point line, he cupped the ball into his wrist and forearm, rocking the ball back and forth before taking off for what Lakers radio broadcaster Chick Hearn best described as a ""Rock The Baby"" slam dunk: he slung the ball around behind his head and dunked over a ducking Cooper. This dunk is generally regarded as one of the greatest dunks of all time.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving earned his bachelor's degree in 1986 through the University Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. After his basketball career ended, he became a businessman, obtaining ownership of a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Philadelphia and doing work as a television analyst. In 1997, he joined the front office of the Orlando Magic as Vice President of RDV Sports and Executive Vice President.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving and former NFL running back Joe Washington fielded a NASCAR Busch Series team from 1998 to 2000, becoming the first ever NASCAR racing team at any level owned completely by minorities. The team had secure sponsorship from Dr Pepper for most of its existence. Erving, a racing fan himself, stated that his foray into NASCAR was an attempt to raise interest in NASCAR among African-Americans.

&amp;#x200B;

He has also served on the Board of Directors of Converse (prior to their 2001 bankruptcy), Darden Restaurants, Inc., Saks Incorporated and The Sports Authority. As of 2009, Erving was the owner of The Celebrity Golf Club International outside of Atlanta, but the club was forced to file for bankruptcy soon after. He was ranked by ESPN as one of the greatest athletes of the 20th Century.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Erving is a Christian. Erving has spoken about his faith, saying, ""After searching for the meaning of life for over ten years, I found the meaning in Jesus Christ.""

&amp;#x200B;

Erving was first called ""Dr.J."" by his friend and teammate on the Nets and Squires, Willie Sojourner.

&amp;#x200B;

Erving was married to Turquoise Erving from 1972 until 2003. Together they had four children. In 2000, their 19-year-old son Cory went missing for weeks, until he was found drowned after driving his vehicle into a pond. Erving has called this the worst day of his life.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1979, Erving began an adulterous affair with sportswriter Samantha Stevenson, resulting in the 1980 birth of American tennis player Alexandra Stevenson. Although Erving's fatherhood of Alexandra Stevenson was known privately to the families involved, it did not become public knowledge until Stevenson reached the semifinals at Wimbledon in 1999, the first year she qualified to play in the tournament. Erving had provided financial support for Stevenson over the years, but had not otherwise been part of her life. The public disclosure of their relationship did not initially lead to contact between father and daughter. However, Stevenson contacted Erving in 2008 and they finally initiated a further relationship. In 2009 Erving attended the Family Circle Cup tennis tournament to see Stevenson play, marking the first time he had attended one of her matches.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2003, he fathered a second child outside of his marriage, Justin Kangas, this time with a woman named Dorýs Madden. Julius and Turquoise Erving were subsequently divorced. Erving continued his relationship with Madden, with whom he had Jules Erving and two others; they married in 2008. Erving has fathered nine children in total.

GoNets,"People seem to be having trouble with W/L points and how seeding in the Division and Conference work, So here is an explanation leading up to Jan 12th vs the Celtics. With help from u/swapan_99","This is a snippet from u/swapan_99 that made me want to write this up. I don't know how to do quotes. Depends on multiple things. If you have beaten the other team and have H2H record over them, that takes precedence. 

If you're tied in H2H, then your division standings get used. If you're tied in division record as well then they use your conference record. If your tied in that as well then record against Playoff eligible teams. By that point, usually there's some discrepancy.

So here's a little bit more. The Nets won on Monday, and the Celtics didn't play. +.5 the Nets gained on the Celtics. The Celtics lost on Tuesday. +.5 gain for the Nets. So a total of +1 was gained in the last 2 days. 

Now, I'm just looking at schedules, and I know the Nets are hot, but I might chime a loss in there for discussion sake. The key game that everything hopefully comes down to is Jan. 12th. Nets vs. Celtics.

Celtics schedule until that game, and I'm just making some predictions for arguments sake.

Jan 5th - Celtics @Dallas. I'd pick the Celtics, but Luka is a beast, so you never know. Celtics W

Jan 7th - Celtics @Spurs. Celtics W

Jan 9th - Bulls @Celtics I hope some (YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE) Doesn't bet a testicle against the Bulls. Celtics W 

Jan 11th - Pelicans @Celtics Toss up if Zion is gonna play but I think this is a Pelicans....while I was looking this up for the Nets I saw Zions out for 3 weeks so this is probably a Celtics win.

If my predictions are right, this would give the Celtics a record of 30 W / 12 L. I think last nights game was a slap in the face, and the Celtics are gonna be PISSED. I also think that smart with all his technicals and elections might see league action soon. I don't watch much Celtics, but I always see him getting thrown out.

And then we have Jan 12th 
Celtics @Nets 

Now, let's look at the Nets schedule.

Jan 4th - Nets @Bulls with how hot we are. This should be a win, but Derozan can go off. I see this as a trap game we win. W

Jan 6th - Nets @Pelicans so I just looked up Zions injury, and he's out 3 weeks, so this is a W

Jan 8th - Nets @Heat I see this as another trap game. In Miami, who has SEVERLY underperformed, but were what the 1 seed last year? Ultimately, another Nets win.

Jan 12th - Celtics @Nets So I see us both winning all our games until this showdown. The Celtics have an extra game in the time span between now and this game. The Nets have 3 1/2 days off before this game while it is a back to back for the Celtics with a somewhat injured but still dangerous Pelicans team. Now here's where the games played and those .5 wins come into play.

If they both win out, The Celtics are going to gain .5 on the Nets just simply due to the number of games played. So in this situation the if the Nets win, they'll be dead even with the Celtics at 30 W / 13 L. So will the Nets be the #1 seed? Let's take a look.

Another mistake. The Nets only have 12 Losses so if everyone wins out then they would take 1st. But just so I don't have to edit anymore let's say the Nets lose to like the Pelicans.

Head to Head.

The Nets vs Celtics would be 1-1 even tie.

Division Record.

The Nets division record is 5-2 with 4 over Tor 1 over Nyk and losses to Phi and Bos.

The Celtics division record is 4-0 with wins over Phi Brk Nyk and Tor.

So the Nets would be 6-2 if they win, and the Celtics would be 4-1. Simple math makes the Nets 3-1, which is .666 and the Celtics would be .750. So if they both win out till Jan 12th and the Nets win they'll still be 2nd seed.

I hope this helps because I typed it out on my phone, and it was a pain in the ass. I even proofread it kinda. Give U/swapan_99 a shout out to for posting a good start and making me stay up and extra 45 minutes typing this out.

One thing I wanted to add. This is a fantastic winning streak, but all streaks do end. Let's not get all butt hurt when they eventually lose.

On TV, it seems like more of the same. A lot of small cheers and what seems like a disinterested crowd. Am I wrong to think this?

GoNets,KD's Affect On Nets' Defensive Rating,"I'm sure you're all familiar with how important Durant is to this team on both ends of the floor, but I was looking at defensive rating and was shocked at how bad things went. 

With KD, nets have a defensive rating of 109.4, which matches with Philly for around 10th best in the league. Without him, they have a defensive rating of 119.4—which is 10 points higher and would rank dead last in the NBA, 3.6 points worst than the Houston Rockets who are currently last. Furthermore, since January 15th (the day of KD's recent injury), the Nets' defensive rating is even lower at 121, which is 5.2 points worse than the last place team. 

Of course other guys, notably Claxton (DRTG without him is still way better than without KD at 111.4 though), have missed some games during this timeframe, so these numbers can be taken with a grain of salt. Even so, it's still astonishing how bad this team's defense gets without him.",23,4,2022-02-08,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/snc3id/kds_affect_on_nets_defensive_rating/

**Constructing an NBA roster requires balance.** The GM needs to understand on-court schemes, but also must account for attitude and effort. Putting big-name talent that fails to gel usually results in disappointment (see Brooklyn Nets, 2013-2014). Assembling a high character team that lacks raw talent generally results in heartbreak…and lots of losses (see Brooklyn Nets, 2016-2017). 

The current Nets have a mix of veterans and unheralded talent. Even through 50 games, they are still experimenting with lineups. Sean Marks may have struck out in free agency this past summer, but it gave a glimpse into the types of players the Nets covet. Analyzing Kenny Atkinson’s system and its influences gives a clue on how Marks aims to build the offense. The Nets have a grocery list to cook up their offensive system. But unlike previous years, they’re looking for sustainably sourced ingredients. It IS Brooklyn, after all. But unfortunately, farmers markets and Whole Foods branches don’t sell draft picks or “unicorn” players.

As I’ve elaborated on previously, the Nets offense emphasizes team ball. It’s the antithesis of previous Nets teams that relied on star power to will them to victory. In the current NBA, lacking a superstar makes winning an uphill battle. Superstars command respect. The Nets lack a top tier player now, and likely for the near future. With their offensive system, the Nets plan on combating star power with ball movement and smart play. But for the offense to work, certain personnel are needed. The Nets may not have players on the level of the Atlanta Hawks and San Antonio Spurs cores, but they can still acquire players that run the offense optimally. Here are a couple of skills needed to run the Atkinson “React and Attack” (can I trademark that?) offensive system.

**Point guard play**

This is the primary building block in Kenny Atkinson’s ideal offense. It’s D’Antoni ball mixed with Spurs philosophy. The chief creator for any basketball team is the point guard, an extension of the coach. Strong point guard play dictates the pace of the offense, balancing passing, scoring, and play off-ball. The Hawks’ team ball featured strong point guard play from Jeff Teague, Shelvin Mack, and Dennis Schroder. All three of these guards were far from being top tier talent. Each player excels in different areas, but all read the offense quickly and make decisions on the fly. These players had the ability to attack the defense…

And find teammates on secondary action…

The systems Kenny Atkinson draws his offensive philosophies from feature strong point guard play. With a solid primary ball handler, the Nets may not have to run a full set if the guard recognizes an open lane or mismatch on the fly. The presence of a point guard to keep the team in check has been missed all season. The infamous Net scoring droughts, and the crippling team turnovers may have occurred less frequently if the team featured a ball handler confident in leading the offense. The Nets no doubt miss Jeremy Lin and, to a lesser extent, Greivis Vasquez, two leaders with experience running an NBA offense. They understand the flow of the game, and can read defensive coverage. Spencer Dinwiddie and Isaiah Whitehead, the two guards tasked to fill in Lin’s and Vasquez’s shoes, have limited lead ball handling experience, looking tentative at times. These two have not been able to control and manage the offense completely just yet. Comfort as a primary ballhandler, and management of the offense is a developmental aspect to monitor as the season progresses.

**Creators off the dribble**

The ability to dribble strong to the basket, and knowledge of when to shoot, and when and where to pass are valuable skills. In Atkinson’s motion offense, the drive and dish is an efficient way to attack opposing defenses. When done successfully, the attack generates open looks or free throws. It makes each pass more effective, with the defense scrambling. Being able to create off the dribble is a skill that multiple players should possess in the Nets’ offense. There should be at least three off the bounce threats on the court for optimal offensive sets. 

In Spurs-land, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili are two premier penetrators with PhD’s in the drive and dish. Kawhi Leonard has added the ability to create off the bounce as well, a key addition in his progression to superstardom. Even the Spurs’ bench unit has players adept in attacking the basket in Kyle Anderson and Patty Mills. The Hawks would often play two point guards down the stretch, to add an additional threat to put defenses on their heels. Even Kyle Korver, primarily known as a catch and shoot assassin, could attack to generate a better shot for himself or for his teammates. Take a look…

[Korver 2](https://gfycat.com/MintyMisguidedGoldfish)

[Korver 3](https://gfycat.com/ComplicatedMadeupArgentineruddyduck)

The ability to put the ball on the floor can set up strong looks right away, or if the defense recovers, swing to find another shot within the flow of the offense. The players Sean Marks targets do not have to be elite penetrators. They just need to make the right decisions when the defense reacts.

Big men have the chance to create off the dribble within Kenny Atkinson’s offense too. The two primary sets in the Nets offense, Strong and Weak, utilize a 4-out 1-in configuration with a big at the top of the key. Sometimes, that big comes off of a screen…

[Big Man Screen Hawks](https://gfycat.com/ZealousSameEquestrian)

The big can also be a pivot point, dishing it to a shooter above or a cutter below (that would be a dope band name)…

[Brand high post](https://gfycat.com/BareShowyBichonfrise)

Other times, the big can jet to the rim on a drive, a wrinkle the Nets have added this season with Trevor Booker and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson playing power forward. RHJ, in particular, has excelled at getting to the rim, usually driving for a layup with contact…

[RHJ Drive and Bucket](http://streamable.com/y4n6f)

Recently, RHJ has improved his finishing at the rim, drawing more fouls and going to the cup under control. On occasion, RHJ can drive and dish to a wing in the corner. 

Even the largest players can take it off the dribble. Al Horford and Paul Millsap were successful at generating offense off the dribble. Here, Millsap scores on an easy layup after faking out his defender on a closeout.

[Millsap easy layup](https://gfycat.com/BigEuphoricKouprey)

Millsap also is skilled enough to find a teammate low on a smart pass

[Millsap assist](https://gfycat.com/SnappyInsidiousHoki)

One of Brook Lopez’s strongest assets as an offensive threat is his ability to attack the paint from the perimeter. Although it may look awkward, it often is more effective, and more beneficial to the offense compared to his post ups. He can get a shot at the rim with the defense moving, or draw a foul on a rotating defender.

[Lopez attacks](http://streamable.com/qjoi9)

Lopez also has been able to find cutters off of his own drives. Two athletic Nets forwards, Quincy Acy and Trevor Booker, have shown the ability to get to the rim as well...

[Acy drive](http://streamable.com/aswdf)

[Booker drive](http://streamable.com/ca90m)

On any type of drive into the lane, it’s important to keep it simple. Nets turnovers often arise from over-dribbling in traffic, or from forcing up a contested shot when swarmed by defenders. Other Nets turnovers have stemmed from driving without a plan, allowing defenders to slide in for a charge. Looking for a foul is fine on a drive, but Nets players have often resorted to this technique a bit too much, without much success in getting the whistle. Future Nets players that attack the basket with control could improve efficiency on offense. 

**Cutters/Movers off the ball**

An underrated part of any player’s game is his off-ball movement. The ability to read how a defender is leaning, or catching him napping is a skill that could yield easy buckets. A top tier player like [Dwyane Wade built his Hall of Fame career by being an exceptional off ball player,](https://youtu.be/cKdToBv0vyc) using his basketball IQ and constant movement to get position for shots or drives. 

Any kind of movement off the ball, whether it’s screening away, curls (for the girls,) or backdoor cuts could complicate things further for the defense. The Nets have had possessions where a strong cut leads to an easy basket or good look from 3. Sean Kilpatrick moves particularly well off the ball when he’s not creating his own offense. A Brook Lopez post up has been a solid option for cutters the past three seasons. Bojan Bogdanovic, in particular, is proficient in cutting off-ball…

[Bogie cut](http://streamable.com/heo6c)

The initial action was a Brook Lopez postup. Bojan catches his defender napping, and darts to the rim, where Brook finds him for an easy layup. Bogdanovic scores on similar attacks often.

[Bojan+Lopez 2 man game](http://streamable.com/lb2qg)

Coming off of an inbounds play, Bogdanovic dumps an entry pass to Brook Lopez in the post. Bojan fakes a cut away from the ball, but runs hard to the strong side corner, receiving a handoff from Lopez for a good look from 3. Any post up play by the Nets should be accompanied by at least some off ball movement.

There have been times when the Nets offense is completely devoid of off ball movement, straying from the system or giving up on the set after the defense stymies the first action. This is when the Nets revert to isolation ball, which occurs often during Nets droughts. 

[Lopez post up no movement](http://streamable.com/6hz3a)

The problem with asking a player to call his own number is not the stopping of the ball. It’s the stopping of player movement that can kill an offense.

Off-ball screening is another minor offensive aspect that can pay major dividends. While not exactly the most successful, the Los Angeles Lakers, under Luke Walton, and the Portland Trailblazers under Terry Stotts use complex off ball screen action to free shooters, or as a decoy to open driving lanes. In an offense where players have free rein to shoot from the perimeter, being able to shoot off of an off ball screen can fuel the offense. The NBA’s best shooters come off of screens with intent. The shooter’s speed, paired with a strong screen, is a deadly weapon.

This season, the Nets offense has used off ball screens to set up the offense, out of Strong and Weak sets (refer to my first post on the Nets offense to see what it looks like). One reason the Nets’ ball movement has suffered at times is because players run through screens without any sense of urgency. Players like Stephen Curry, Kyle Korver, and JJ Redick, who could rain threes with their eyes closed, come off screens at full speed every time. Coming off a screen lackadaisically allows the defense time to adjust and close out. It may be a minor criticism, but it could be beneficial when assessing future Nets players.

*There is* much work to be done constructing the Nets roster. Offensive skills range far greater than shooting, dribbling and passing. The Nets could acquire a speedy point guard, or a slasher that gets into the lane at will, but their decision-making speed may determine if a possession ends in a basket or a turnover. I may have written way too much on the value of moving off of the ball, but it can be critical. At this point in a lost season, Marks and Co. should already be looking at players to target this summer in free agency and the NBA draft.

GoNets,Showing love for our sistas and a thought about free agency appeal.,"So the Tsai-owned Liberty will play two games this season in Barclays.  If it’s not your thing, save the lame comments,  but I’m excited.  A little PSA. Let’s support them.  

One of the games they’re playing is against the Chinese national team.  That got me thinking...Nets will be playing the Lakers in China...Alibaba and the NBA announced plans to expand partnership.  If the Nets can ever get really good, which they’re trending that way, they may have a direct path to being a sensation in China.  In this day and age with players being concerned about brands but more than that, even getting into ownership, wouldn’t that be an extremely appealing selling point to free agents, additional business opportunities in China?

GoNets,"The Two Versions of Kyrie we Saw Today, and the word that divides them.","So i'm rewatching this presser and trying to make some sense of Kyrie.

Here's what I got.

Kyrie's first bit is awkward. His shoulders are tight, as is his demeanor. It's hard to get a read on him, and his words feel halting - awkward. He wants this to be good and he clearly cares, but his guard is up, and while positive, he's not comfortable.

But as he gets into the things that sold him on the Nets, he discusses the family atmosphere, which get's him to thinking about his grandfather, and then his grandfather's passing... and then the second Kyrie says the word 'depression', you see the weight fall off his shoulders, and a small smile emerge. You see the positive impact of him just saying it, getting it off his chest (and mind)...

This, clearly, is a man who's been feeling a lot of weight - the weight of his word (re: resigning) crumbling in Boston, the weight of close family passing, the weight of championships that should have been, and his true promise as a leader - a role that has thus far eluded him.

However, during this press conference, once you see him pay respects to his feelings - and the 'depression' wrought by his Grandddad's passing (and his distance, due to basketball), the entire tone of his time shifts - it's pretty dramatic, actually - the lightness - the smile, the willingness to engage, and the clear desire he has to \_talk\_ about where he is at, now.

So. here's to hoping Kyrie can continue to be honest - and open - with his teammates, this organization, and maybe (to some extent) his fans.  I've been watching Kyrie highlights since early July and.. while Im \_truely, deeply\_ sad to loose the aesthetics of D-Lo's game... if we had to choose one person who can offer up something equally awesome/transcendent but also sortof \_totally different\_, it would be Kyrie.

the brooklyn backcourt is bonkers.... and then we'll sub in Dinwiddie and the onslaught will \_just\_not\_stop\_

i love it. I'm so, so, so excited to see what happens with this team. I don't really care how many games we win right now, or whatever whatever... I just want to see these guys - these friends - ball out with their bros.",18,9,2019-09-27,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/da6s9l/the_two_versions_of_kyrie_we_saw_today_and_the/
GoNets,13 Days Until Brooklyn Basketball. #13 Kendall Gill.,"Gill had a career year as a Net in '96-'97 after being dealt from Charlotte for Kenny Anderson. He remained steady even after the emergence of Kerry Kittles and debut of KVH.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Wiki: Kendall Cedric Gill (born May 25, 1968) is an American retired professional basketball player who now works as a television basketball analyst.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill was born in Chicago and attended Rich Central High School in Olympia Fields, Illinois. Graduating in 1986 as a senior, Gill led Rich Central to a 2nd-place finish in the IHSA class AA state boys basketball tournament. Gill led Rich Central in scoring with 54 points in the 4 games of the tournament finals, and was named to the six-player All-Tournament team.

&amp;#x200B;

After high school, Gill attended the University of Illinois. Playing four years for the Fighting Illini, Gill was a starter for his last three seasons. As a junior, Gill led the Fighting Illini to the 1989 Final Four before losing to Michigan on a last second shot. Also among that fabled ""Flyin' Illini"" squadron were future NBA players Nick Anderson, Marcus Liberty, Kenny Battle and Illini TV/radio broadcaster Stephen Bardo as well as four-year starter, Lowell Hamilton. As a senior, Gill led the Big Ten in scoring and was named a first-team All-American (UPI). Gill left Illinois as the 7th all-time leading scorer in school history. Gill's Illini earned NCAA bids each year he played. Gill also won the NCAA Slam Dunk championship at the Final Four his senior season.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill was elected to the ""Illini Men's Basketball All-Century Team"" in 2004.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill was chosen in the 1990 NBA draft as the fifth overall pick by the Charlotte Hornets, and was named First Team All-Rookie for the 1990–91 season. Kendall also participated in an NBA Slam-Dunk Competition. Gill played 15 seasons in the NBA. He averaged over 20 points as a second-year player for the Hornets in 1991–92 (20.5 ppg). He spent a majority of his career playing for the Hornets (including two separate stints).

&amp;#x200B;

Gill also played for the Seattle SuperSonics for two seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill was then traded to the New Jersey Nets. Gill had the best year of his career scoring-wise with the Nets in 1996–97 (21.8 ppg). In the 1998–99 NBA season, Gill led the league in steals as a member of the Nets. On April 3, 1999, he recorded 11 steals in a game against Miami, tying a single-game record set by Larry Kenon during the 1976–77 season. In this game, he also recorded 15 points and 10 rebounds for a rare Points-Rebounds-Steals triple double. In the 1999–00 season, he also made a half-court shot against the Orlando Magic that hit the top of the backboard and swished in the net.

&amp;#x200B;

He also was a member of the Miami Heat near the end of his career.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill played for the Minnesota Timberwolves as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill played for the Chicago Bulls for a season too. He wore number 13.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill played with the Bucks for a short period of time before retiring from the NBA.

&amp;#x200B;

In the 1998–99 NBA season, Gill led the league in steals as a member of the Nets. Gill's career totals include 12,914 points in 966 regular season games. He made an appearance as himself in a Nickelodeon TV Show My Brother and Me.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill was brought up in Matteson and lived in Matteson.

&amp;#x200B;

As a means to maintain his conditioning, Gill took up boxing, eventually entering the professional ranks. Gill had his first bout on June 25, 2005 at the age of 37.

&amp;#x200B;

He appeared on the January 23, 2008 edition of Spike TV's Pros vs. Joes.

&amp;#x200B;

On May 15, 2010, Gill sang a rendition of ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" at Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, as they took on the Pittsburgh Pirates.

&amp;#x200B;

Gill has provided analysis during pregame and postgame shows on Comcast SportsNet Chicago for Chicago Bulls games. On March 22, 2013, Gill was suspended by Comcast SportsNet for the remainder of the 2012–13 season after a reported physical altercation with analyst Tim Doyle in the Comcast SportsNet newsroom. In September 2013, Gill indicated that he was not returning to the station. However, he was rehired by Comcast SportsNet in late 2015.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2017, Gill was signed as a free agent in the BIG3 basketball league by Power to take the place of Corey Maggette after he suffered an injury during the season.

GoNets,I'd love to get T Spoon involved with the Nets.,"I'm gonna talk about the Liberty.  I get it's not for everyone, so if it's not your thing, cool.  Just walk on by.  

To those who haven't noticed, the Liberty are regularly packing Barclays.  They're also doing something unique in NYC - they're uniting the city's sports fans.  Even Spike Lee is now semi regular at Barclays, sitting next to Clara Wu Tsai.  They're getting basketball fans used to coming to Barclays frequently, where maybe some outside the borough wouldn't normally.  

One of the teams' legends is Teresa Weatherspoon. I think most NYC basketball fans at least know the name but she was a heart and soul player that fans loved and still do to this day.  I'd love the Liberty to bring her back in some way but they have a championship-winning coach.  Would she do a TV gig?  Maybe but she is a gym rat type, needs to develop players.  She would probably make an excellent college coach.  

She had a brief coaching stint with the Chicago Sky and a lot of players credited their development to her, namely Angel Reese.  She was part of the Pelicans' development team prior to that.  

Now, I'm a big believer in letting the coach choose his staff, but considering all the youth on the squad, they should have the largest developmental staff in the league.  Adding T Spoon to it could be a good experienced addition, as well as bringing in some fan support from Liberty fans to a team that's likely to lose 65 games this year.

It's really cool.,12,19,2019-04-20,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/bfhh8k/brooklyn_has_by_far_the_most_entertaining_breaks/
GoNets,2021 Bag Policy,"What’s good team. I am tryna see a few games this year after work and was wondering if they still allow backpacks to be checked at the Dean St. entrance. I also carry a water bottle to work and was curious if they’d let me bring that in as well so long as I empty it before.

Update: Went to the Heat game. Bag was fine, but was told “buy a new water bottle or throw it in someone’s car.” Lfg Nets",11,10,2021-10-27,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/qh19g8/2021_bag_policy/
GoNets,Arena Atmosphere,I’m going to be in NYC staying at a hotel in Times Square from 2/25-2/28. I’m debating going to the Nets vs Spurs game cause I love seeing different arenas and I could see Wemby play. I know the nets are rebuilding but what’s the arena like? Would it be worth my time to go out that way to see them play. I also wouldn’t mind seeing Cam or MPJ chuck 40 shots. ,11,9,2025-11-22,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1p45fo6/arena_atmosphere/

GoNets,Visiting NY. Go to Nets weekend or weekday game?,"Hey everyone,

I am from Belgium and am visiting New York for a week in February. The three persons I am travelling with and I want to go watch an NBA game while we're there. Options seem to currently be:

- Brooklyn Nets vs Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday Feb 04 at 12:00pm (about 27 dollars per ticket)
- Brooklyn Nets vs Houston Rockets on Tuesday Feb 06 at 7:30pm (about 50 dollars per ticket)

We want to keep the cost down as much as possible to have money to spend on other things, but we still want to see a decent game though. Is there a big difference in crowd ambiance atmosphere between weekend or weekday games? The Milwaukee Bucks game seemed like a good deal, but because it is twice as cheap I am afraid that there won't be a nicely filled stadium. However for the Houston Rockets game, I am afraid Brooklyn Nets might perhaps lose pretty hard heh.

Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!",10,9,2017-12-10,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/7iumsx/visiting_ny_go_to_nets_weekend_or_weekday_game/
GoNets,Yo what’s up Nets fans! I’m going to my first basketball game tonight and was wondering if…,Is seating similar to other sporting events where if there are empty seats after the first half or so you can go fill in the seats in the lower areas?

GoNets,Best Seats for My First Nets Game? Need Advice!,"**Hi everyone,**

I know this topic has been discussed before, but I’d really appreciate your help in making my visit to NY worthwhile!

I’ll be in town later this month and want to catch the Nets vs. OKC game on February 26. I’ve found tickets within my budget but can’t decide between:

* **Section 31, Row 17**
* **A corner section (204, 212, 220, or 228), Row 2**

Does Section 31 offer a better experience in terms of view and atmosphere, or is Row 17 too far back? I’ve seen some posts recommending the corner sections—would that be a better choice?

Also, do you think this game is a good pick for a basketball fan? Since it’s on a Wednesday, I’m not sure what the atmosphere will be like.

EDIT: what are my chances of getting better seats by waiting until the last minute for prices to drop? 

If you have any seat recommendations or tips to make my first NBA game unforgettable, I’d love to hear them!

Thanks so much!",8,5,2025-02-09,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/1ils8ru/best_seats_for_my_first_nets_game_need_advice/
GoNets,"First time visiting the Barclays center, couple questions.","Visiting from the UK and bought tickets for the pre season game against philly and I have a couple of questions. 

I've been on the Barclays Center website and it says I can either go to Atlantic Avenue, Lafayette Avenue or Fulton Street. Is Atlantic Avenue really busy as it's the closest? Should I go to one of the other stations and miss the crowds?

Should I get some food/beer at the barclays center or are the prices extortionate? I'm used to paying $8/9 for a beer at soccer games in the UK. Anywhere nearby you'd recommend to grab a beer and a burger beforehand? Someone suggested Cyprus Avenue in another thread, wouldn't mind going somewhere with a bit of an atmosphere with other Nets fans, will there be like that?

Also, should I go and see the warm-ups? Not something I normally do at soccer games but that's because they don't let you drink beer in your seat. 

Thanks in advance, /r/gonets.",8,15,2014-10-06,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/2ifxbk/first_time_visiting_the_barclays_center_couple/

GoNets,Some cross-promotion,"Gotta do some cross-promotion, fam. I support most things Brooklyn pretty hard (having some trouble fully embracing the Islanders though). That's what we do. Brooklynites are the proudest New Yorkers. For BK fans who are also soccer fans, there's a pro soccer team now in Brooklyn. The New York Cosmos are now playing at MCU Park and had their home opener yesterday. It's a fun atmosphere, which should only be more fun when Coney Island opens up for the summer. 

So let's show them some love. After all, spread love is the Brooklyn way! ",7,4,2017-04-03,https://reddit.com/r/GoNets/comments/633vfm/some_crosspromotion/
